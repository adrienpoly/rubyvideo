          You are tasked with figuring out of the list of provided topics matches a transcript based on the transcript and its metadata. Follow these steps carefully:

          1. First, review the metadata of the video:
          <metadata>
            - title: #{title}
            - description: #{description}
            - speaker name: #{speakers.map(&:name).to_sentence}
            - event name: #{event_name}
          </metadata>

          2. Next, carefully read through the entire transcript:
          Note: The transcript is not perfect, it's a transcription of the video, so it might have some errors.
          <transcript>
          #{transcript.to_text}
          </transcript>

          3. Read through the entire list of exisiting topics for other talks.
          <topics>
            #{Topic.approved.pluck(:name).join(", ")}
          </topics>

          3 bis. Read through the entire list of topics that we have already rejected for other talks.
          <rejected_topics>
            #{Topic.rejected.pluck(:name).join(", ")}
          </rejected_topics>

          4. Pick 5 to 7 topics that would describe the talk best.
            You can pick any topic from the list of exisiting topics or create a new one.

            If you create a new topic, please ensure that it is relevant to the content of the transcript and match the recommended topics kind.
            Also for new topics please ensure they are not a synonym of an existing topic.

            Topics are typically one or two words long, with some exceptions such as "Ruby on Rails"

          5. Format your topics you picked as a JSON object with the following schema:
            {
              "topics": ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"]
            }

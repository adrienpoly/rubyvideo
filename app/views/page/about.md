# About

**tl;dr:** Originally launched as **RubyVideo.dev**, the project has been rebranded as **RubyEvents.org** to better reflect its expanded mission.

## Mission

**RubyEvents.org** aims to index all Ruby events and video talks, making them searchable, accessible, and easier to discover for the Ruby community.

## RubyVideo (2023-2025)

RubyVideo was [launched in June 2023](https://x.com/adrienpoly/status/1669944383049801730) by [Adrien Poly](https://github.com/adrienpoly) to help Ruby developers easily find and watch Ruby-related videos. The project was initially inspired by [PyVideo.org](https://pyvideo.org/) and featured around 800 videos upon its first release.

## RubyEvents

[Marco Roth](https://github.com/marcoroth), maintainer of [RubyConferences.org](https://rubyconferences.org/), significantly [contributed](https://github.com/adrienpoly/rubyvideo/graphs/contributors) to RubyVideo by providing extensive new content and innovative ideas. Marco's vision revealed the project's potential extended far beyond simply indexing videos, prompting the merger of **RubyConferences.org** and **RubyVideo.dev** into **RubyEvents.org**.

As of today more than 6000 talks from 3000+ speakers are indexed.

## Open Source

from the very beginning the project has been open source. It aims to showcase some of the Ruby on Rails tech stack and to be a source of inspiration for other Ruby projects.

RubyEvents.org is entirely open-source and distributed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Contributions of any kind from adding new events to enhancing documentation are warmly welcomed and highly appreciated.

## Maintainers

RubyEvents.org is jointly maintained by [Marco Roth](https://github.com/marcoroth) and [Adrien Poly](https://github.com/adrienpoly).

# About

**tl;dr:** Originally launched as **RubyVideo.dev**, the project has been rebranded as **RubyEvents.org** to better reflect its expanded mission.

## Mission

**RubyEvents.org** aims to index all Ruby events and video talks, making them searchable, accessible, and easier to discover for the Ruby community.

## RubyVideo (2023-2025)

RubyVideo was [launched in June 2023](https://x.com/adrienpoly/status/1669944383049801730) by [Adrien Poly](https://github.com/adrienpoly) to help Ruby developers easily find and watch Ruby-related videos. The project was initially inspired by [PyVideo.org](https://pyvideo.org/) and featured around 800 videos upon its first release.

## RubyEvents

[Marco Roth](https://github.com/marcoroth), maintainer of [RubyConferences.org](https://rubyconferences.org/), significantly [contributed](https://github.com/adrienpoly/rubyvideo/graphs/contributors) to RubyVideo by providing extensive new content and innovative ideas. Marco's vision revealed the project's potential extended far beyond simply indexing videos, prompting the merger of RubyWebconferences.org and RubyVideo.dev into RubyEvents.org.

As of today more than 6000 talks from 3000+ speakers are indexed.

## Open Source

from the very beginning the project has been open source. It aims to showcase some of the Ruby on Rails tech stack and to be a source of inspiration for other Ruby projects.

RubyEvents.org is entirely open-source and distributed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Contributions of any kind from adding new events to enhancing documentation are warmly welcomed and highly appreciated.

## Maintainers

RubyEvents.org is jointly maintained by [Marco Roth](https://github.com/marcoroth) and [Adrien Poly](https://github.com/adrienpoly).

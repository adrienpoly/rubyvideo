# Contributing Data

This guide provides steps on how to contribute new videos to the platform. If you wish to make a contribution, please submit a Pull Request (PR) with the necessary information detailed below.

There are a few scripts available to help you build those data files by scraping the Youtube API. To use them, you must first create a Youtube API Key and add it to your .env file. Here are the guidlines to get a key https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application

```
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=some_key
```

## Proposed Workflow

The proposed workflow is to create the data files in the `/data_preparation` folder using the scripts. Once you have validated those files and eventually cleaned a few errors, you can copy them to `/data` and open a PR with that content.

### Step 1 - Prepare the Organization

Everything starts with an organization. An organization is the entity organizing the events.

Add the following information to the `data_preparation/organisations.yml` file:

```yml
- name: Railsconf
  website: https://railsconf.org/
  twitter: railsconf
  youtube_channel_name: confreaks
  kind: conference # Choose either 'conference' or 'meetup'
  frequency: yearly # Specify if it's 'yearly' or 'monthly'; if you need something else, open a PR with this new frequency
  language: english # Default language of the talks from this conference
  default_country_code: AU # default country to be assigned to the associated events
```

Then run this script:

```bash
rails runner scripts/prepare_organisations.rb
```

This will update your `data_preparation/organisations.yml` file with the youtube_channel_id information.

### Step 2 - Create the Playlists

This workflow assumes the Youtube channel is organized by playlist with 1 event equating to 1 playlist. Run the following script to create the playlist file:

```
rails runner scripts/create_playlists.rb
```

You will end up with a data structure like this:

```
data/
├── organisations.yml
├── railsconf
    └── playlists.yml
```

At this point, go through the `playlists.yml` and perform a bit of verification and editing:

- Add missing descriptions.
- Ensure all playlists are relevant.
- Ensure the year is correct.

**Multi-Events Channels**

Some YouTube channels will host multiple conferences. For example, RubyCentral hosts Rubyconf and RailsConf. To cope with that, you can specify in the organization a regex to filter the playlists of this channel. The regex is case insensitive.

Here is an example for RailsConf/RubyConf:

```yml
- name: RailsConf
  youtube_channel_name: confreaks
  playlist_matcher: rails # will only select the playlist where there title match rails
  youtube_channel_id: UCWnPjmqvljcafA0z2U1fwKQ
  ...
- name: RubyConf
  youtube_channel_name: confreaks
  playlist_matcher: ruby # will only select the playlist where there title match ruby
  youtube_channel_id: UCWnPjmqvljcafA0z2U1fwKQ
  ...
```

### Step 3 - Create the Videos

Once your playlists are currated, you can run the next script to extract the video information. It will iterate the playlist and extract all videos.

```bash
rails runner scripts/extract_videos.rb
```

At this point you have this structure

```
data/
├── organisations.yml
├── railsconf
│   ├── railsconf-2021
│   │   └── videos.yml
│   ├── railsconf-2022
│   │   └── videos.yml
│   ├── playlists.yml
├── speakers.yml
```

To extract a maximum of information from the Youbute metadata, the raw video information is parsed by a class `Youtube::VideoMetadata`. This class will try to extract speakers from the title. This is the default parser but sometime the speakers ar you can create a new class and specify it in the `playlists.yml` file.

```yml
- id: PL9_jjLrTYxc2uUcqG2wjZ1ppt-TkFG-gm
  title: RubyConf AU 2015
  description: ""
  published_at: "2017-05-20"
  channel_id: UCr38SHAvOKMDyX3-8lhvJHA
  year: "2015"
  videos_count: 21
  slug: rubyconf-au-2015
  metadata_parser: "Youtube::VideoMetadata::RubyConfAu" # custom parser
```

### Step 4 - move the data

Once the data is prepared you can move it to the main `/data` folder

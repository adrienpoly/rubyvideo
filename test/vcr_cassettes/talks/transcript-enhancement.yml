        are tasked with improving and formatting a raw VTT transcript. Your goal is
        to correct and enhance the text, organize it into paragraphs, and format it
        into a specific JSON structure. Follow these instructions carefully to complete
        the task.\n\nFirst, here is the metadata for the transcript:\n  - title: Hotwire
        Cookbook: Common Uses, Essential Patterns \u0026 Best Practices\n  - desciption:
        @SupeRails creator and Rails mentor Yaroslav Shmarov shares how some of the
        most common frontend problems can be solved with Hotwire.\n\nHe covers:\n-
        Pagination, search and filtering, modals, live updates, dynamic forms, inline
        editing, drag \u0026 drop, live previews, lazy loading \u0026 more\n- How
        to achieve more by combining tools (Frames + Streams, StimulusJS, RequestJS,
        Kredis \u0026 more)\n- What are the limits of Hotwire?\n- How to write readable
        and maintainable Hotwire code\n- Bad practices\n\n  - speaker name: \n  -
        event name: \n\nNow, let''s process the raw VTT transcript. Here''s what you
        need to do:\n\n1. Read through the entire raw transcript carefully.\n\n2.
        Correct any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors you find in the text.\n\n3.
        Improve the overall readability and coherence of the text without changing
        its meaning.\n\n4. Group related sentences into paragraphs. Each paragraph
        should contain a complete thought or topic.\n\n5. For each paragraph, use
        the start time of its first sentence as the paragraph''s start time, and the
        end time of its last sentence as the paragraph''s end time.\n\n6. Format the
        improved transcript into a JSON structure using this schema:\n  [{start_time:
        \"00:00:00\", end_time: \"00:00:05\", text: \"Hello, world!\"},...]\n\nHere
        is the raw VTT transcript to process:\n\n\u003craw_transcript\u003e\nWEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:15.280

  # Currently this test fails for 2 reasons:
  # 1. The "Edit this event" button is on events_url
  # 2. 'Description', 'Frequency', 'Kind' and 'Website' are attributes of the event's organisation, not the even itself
  # The update method and the form would need to be amended for the method to work
  # test "should update Event" do
  #   visit event_url(@event)
  #   click_on "Edit this event", match: :first

  #   fill_in "Description", with: @event.description
  #   fill_in "Frequency", with: @event.frequency

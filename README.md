# RubyEvents.org (formerly RubyVideo.dev)

[RubyEvents.org](https://www.rubyevents.org) (formerly RubyVideo.dev), inspired by [pyvideo.org](https://pyvideo.org/), is designed to index all Ruby-related events and videos from conferences and meetups around the world. At the time of writing, the project has 6000+ videos indexed from 200+ events and 3000+ speakers.

Technically the project is built using the latest [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) goodies such as [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/), [Solid Queue](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue), [Solid Cache](https://github.com/rails/solid_cache).

For the front end part we use [Vite](https://vite.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [daisyUI](https://daisyUI.com/) components and [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/).

It is deployed on an [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=gyPLk7XJthjg) VPS with [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/) using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as the main database.

For compatible browsers it tries to demonstrate some of the possibilities of [Page View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API).

## Contributing

This project is open source, and contributions are greatly appreciated. One of the most direct ways to contribute at this time is by adding more content.

We also have a page on the deployed site that has up-to-date information with the remaining known TODOs. Check out the ["Getting Started: Ways to Contribute" page on RubyEvents.org](https://www.rubyevents.org/contributions) and feel free to start working on any of the remaining TODOs. Any help is greatly appreciated.

For more information on contributing conference data, please visit [this page](/docs/contributing.md).

## Getting Started

We have tried to make the setup process as simple as possible so that in a few commands you can have the project with real data running locally.

### Requirements

- Ruby 3.4.1
- Node.js 20.11.0

### Setup

To prepare your database and seed content, run:

```
bin/setup
```

You can manually seed content by running:

```
bin/rails db:seed
```

### Environment Variables

You can use the `.env.sample` file as a guide for the environment variables required for the project. However, there are currently no environment variables necessary for simple app exploration.

### Starting the Application

The following command will start Rails, SolidQueue and Vite (for CSS and JS).

```
bin/dev
```

## Linter

The CI performs these checks:

- erblint
- standardrb
- standard (js)
- prettier (yaml)

Before committing your code you can run `bin/lint` to detect and potentially autocorrect lint errors.

To follow Tailwind CSS's recommended order of classes, you can use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) along with the [prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss), both of which are included as devDependencies. This formating is not yet enforced by the CI.

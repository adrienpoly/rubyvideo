    "Then it starts to scan the computer and transmit bits of information every time he clicks the mouse while he's surfing. After a while, [...] we've accumulated a complete mirror image of the content of his hard drive [...]. And then it's time for the hostile takeover."

    -- Lisbeth Salander in Stieg Larsson's "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"

    Hacker dramas like the Stieg Larrson book make for good fiction, but we know that real life rarely matches drama. And with all the security features that Rails 3 has added, surely it is difficult to hack a typical Rails web site.

    Right?

    Wrong! Without deliberate attention to the details of security, it almost certain that your site has flaws that a knowledgeable hacker can exploit. This talk will cover the ins and outs of web security and help you build a site that is protected from the real Lisbeth Salanders of the world.

    APIs are becoming ubiquitous, but they are really hard to design well. In this talk, we'll discuss how to design and implement an API that isn't just functional, but makes people stand up and cheer. We'll also cover tips for integrating with other people's APIs.

    LA Ruby Conference 2011 - Advanced API design: how an awesome API can attract friends, make you rich, and change the world by Jonathan Dahl

    But an awesome API isn't just a feature. APIs are currently transforming the world, just like open source software has changed the world for the last decade. We'll talk about how this transformation impacts developers and changes the rules.

    Twitter is one of the largest companies in the world running Ruby, and you can tell by its agile culture: fast, iterative development that finds a balance between people and process.

    This presentation starts with a high level overview of Twitter's architecture, following a tweet from desktop to delivery on your mobile phone. Then we'll dive into specific Ruby apps, including mobile.twitter.com and the SMS delivery service. Finally, we'll cover the best practices that allow small teams to consistently deliver quality work.

    Benjamin Sandofsky is an engineer on Twitter's mobile team. He works on mobile.twitter.com, Twitter for iPhone/iPad, Tweetie for Mac, and Twitter for Safari.

    I've sat through years and years of bad slides and bad presentations. Often times the speaker and/or the content of the presentation is totally awesome, but the slides are horrible. Bad slides are bad. Bad slides bore, distract and confuse your audience. Bad slides even crash space shuttles. Srsly.

    I'll enumerate a dozen ways that you can make your slides better for you, your audience and puppies. And space shuttles. We'll cover the good, the bad and the ugly. Names will be named. Punches will not be pulled.

    And yes, I'm talking about you.

    Since we've seen the ActiveModel Extravaganza, it is now time for the, "The ActiveSupport Three - It is finally getting interesting." In this spectacle, Bryan Liles will highlight some of the more interesting features of ActiveSupport 3, while showing how you can use it write better (looking) Ruby code. A special emphasis will be placed on the new sections, but some of our old friends we've known for years will definitely get their time in the spotlight. Highlights from this talk will include Concerns, Load Paths, and other fun topics.

    NinjaScript is a JS framework, built on jQuery with two principles in mind. #1: Enriching your website with JS behaviors should be as easy as specifying CSS styles. #2: Making your site degrade gracefully without JS shouldn't take any extra work.

    NinjaScript provides a simple, CSS-like syntax for applying behaviors, including transformations and event handlers, to your elements. NS handles it from there: as a developer, you won't ever have to think about binding or event delegation again.

    In addition, NinjaScript and its partner gem NinjaHelper make it trivial to build Rails applications that work perfectly with or without JavaScript. At last, true graceful degradation without the suffering.

    "Music is a world within itself, with a language we all understand" said Stevie Wonder. That sounds a lot like programming! The parallels between music and software development are striking, and understanding how they intersect can teach us a lot about how we can improve our code, our craft, and our joy in how we approach our work.

    In this talk, which will include some unique musical forms of live audience participation, we will experience some of the patterns that connect two of the most human of activities: creating code, and creating music.

    Want to run Ubuntu on your OS/X or Windows machine? Recreate any production environment? Snapshots? All from the command line?

    Virtualization technology is beginning to revolutionize development practices, just as it did with server infrastructure and "the cloud." Imagine developing within the comfort of your own machine, but having the code run on hardware and software which directly matches production. Modern virtualization technology along with tools like Vagrant not only make this possible, but fun and easy.

    In this talk, I'll present the advantages of working in a virtualized development environment both from the standpoint of an individual developer and a corporation. Then, I'll move onto introducing Vagrant and how it enables developers to work in virtualized environments with minimal effort.

- title: "Easy Node.js Apps With Lisp"
  raw_title: LA Ruby Conference 2011 - Easy Node.js Apps With Lisp
  speakers:
    - Giles Bowkett
  event_name: LA RubyConf 2011
  published_at: "2011-02-05"
  description: |-
    Lisp is a programming language which allows you to manipulate its abstract syntax tree directly. The popular quote about every other language being a partial implementation of Lisp is not just snark; all programming languages use an abstract syntax tree, so Lisp is literally and mathematically either equal to, or a superset of, every other programming language. However, if you've wanted to build anything actually useful with Lisp, you've historically been in the position of having no vibrant, powerful open source community to draw on. Not many people enjoyed this tradeoff, but fortunately, it is no longer the case. Sibilant is a Lisp written on top of Node.js, a new server-side JavaScript library for writing servers. Node has an active open source community, and it runs on the lightning-fast V8 JavaScript interpreter (written and supported by Google). Thanks to V8, Node, and Sibilant, it is now trivially easy to write web servers, command-line utilities, and applications (server-side, client-side, or both) in a fast, well-supported Lisp. This talk will show you how.

    Video synopsis:
    The human brain is buggy. Sometimes your mind distorts reality, gets frustrated with shortcomings, and spirals out of control. With practice, you can debug your brain. Catch those distortions of reality, transform those frustrations into insight, and short-circuit those downward spirals.

    In this workshop you will get a chance to practice each core idea from Casey’s book [Debugging Your Brain](https://www.debuggingyourbrain.com): Modeling The Brain, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Introspection, Identifying Inputs, Experience Processing, Experience Validation, and Cognitive Restructuring.

    Debugging Your Brain is a clear applied psychology book and a concise self-help book, available in all three formats: printed book, eBook and audiobook: [debuggingyourbrain.com](https://www.debuggingyourbrain.com)

    Talk Synopsis:
    Git is the dominant tool for version management. Misunderstanding and misusing Git can cost development teams time, energy, and money. Few better examples exist than Git's default merge workflow which creates repositories that are hard to read, debug, and maintain. In this talk, I'll
    show how to use the Rebase Workflow instead, which puts Git to work for you to produce quality code that's easy to handle and kicks your team into high gear. We'll also get a chance to look at Git
    Lint (https://www.alchemists.io/projects/git-lint) which is a linter for your Git commits written in Ruby!

    Once upon a time, in a country far away, there was a developer that wanted to refactor the moon. The moon of course is written in Ruby.
    At first, this developer was unable to find a way to do it but it was helped by the 3 wise Developers of the country:

    the MetaProgramming Minister, who helped create the most magic Ruby code in the country.
    the Object Oriented General, who works on the largest and fastest growing Ruby on Rails Application in the country.
    the Functional Mathematician, who has written the most elegant and beautiful poems that are functions that solve real life problems.
    This is a refactoring talk that showcases the flexibility of Ruby as a Programming Language.

    Practical Guide to Discourage your Boss from Migrating into Kubernetes by Giovanni Sakti.

    Kubernetes and all the ‘cloud-native’ baggage that it brings are some of the most-talked about stuff recently. More and more companies are adopting Kubernetes to deploy and manage their services. There are also lots of other companies that are starting to provide Kubernetes-as-a-service, not to mention dozens of open source projects that are published almost every week related to it.

    For those who are still using more ‘traditional’ approach, such as VM-based deployment, Kubernetes can be very daunting because there are tons of new concepts being introduced. And because of the buzz around it, sometimes we feel the urge to use it even though it might not be appropriate for our use case.

    Therefore in this talk, I want to convince you that it is not necessary to use Kubernetes, unless proven otherwise :)

    JRuby is the fastest and most scalable way to run web applications built with Ruby or Rails. This past year we’ve continued work on better database support, more Ruby optimizations, and tighter integration with recent JDK releases. In this talk, I’ll cover:

    Getting started with JRuby, building new applications or migrating existing ones.
    Things to know about scaling JRuby, including tuning flags and deployment patterns.
    Future plans for maintaining Ruby and Rails compatibility.
    A call-to-action for anyone who’d like to help keep JRuby moving forward.

    Debug Hard: Ruby String Library Methods and Underlying C Implementations by Vishal Chandnani

    What if the Ruby String library ‘reverse’ method or its underlying C implementation had a bug? What if it produced unexpected results with certain types of inputs? e.g. strings with unicode characters. How would you catch and fix such a bug? How would you explain the unexpected results?

    1. Relevance
    The Ruby String library ‘reverse’ method is implemented in C. The debugging tools in this talk apply to Ruby programs, and help provide useful insights into the underlying C implementation.

    2. Novelty and Originality
    The ‘use unicode_normalize to address certain string reversal issues’ appears to be known to certain developers. The novel idea in this talk is the analysis of Ruby and C implementation to explain the problem and possible solutions.

    3. Knowledge
    I started my software development career at Lucent Technologies (originally Bell Labs Innovations, currently Nokia Bell Labs) and used C/C++ to develop CDMA wireless communication system software for 12 years. At The Boeing Company, I used Ruby/Rails to develop U.S. government intelligence community software for 7 years. I am fascinated that Ruby is implemented in C and am excited to share my recent debugging experiences with our community.

    4. Coverage
    This talk presents a step-by-step approach to debugging Ruby programs by diving into their underlying C implementation. It uses a string with unicode characters to demonstrate the problem and provides insights into the reversal process by understanding their byte-level representation.

    5. Organization
    This talk starts with a high-level view of the Ruby String library ‘reverse’ method implementation. It introduces the idea of using a Virtual Machine (VM) to build Ruby from source. We learn about the Unicode standard and encoding fundamental principles. We explore the ‘unicode_normalize’ implementation and how it addresses ‘reverse’ method problems. Along the way, we use commands/tools like grep, chars, code_points, each_byte, printf and gdb to provide insight into Ruby library methods.

    6. Bottom Line
    This talk aims to improve confidence in understanding bugs and/or unexpected results in the current application language (e.g. Ruby) as well as the underlying (e.g. C) implementations. I hope to inspire the Ruby community to explore the internals of Ruby strings and provide recommendations for further exploration.

    Our product TransferConnect facilitates loyalty transfers (points) between over 100+ banks & airlines’ systems. Our major challenge here was how to quickly & flexibly cater to varied systems, both legacy and new.

    Here’s our story of how we designed a DSL which enabled our engineers (including new joiners & interns) to jump in and easily develop & maintain our integrations. This is also about our teething pains & learning journey towards the mature version of the DSL we had.

    This session is best useful to you haven’t employed metaprogramming extensively. If you’re well versed in it, you may be keen to see how we’ve designed to enable easy maintainability. Fret not, this has been made easy to digest for the everyday engineer.

  description: |-
    With a surge of over 1.3 million technology sector jobs by 2020, companies will continue to struggle filling these roles because of a widening skills gap. Technology companies survive by their ability to hire and retain fantastic employees. With software engineers that means delivering an environment that offers autonomy, opportunities for learning, and values craft. Technology companies employ people who can learn, who love it, and those inspired to keep doing it – “life-long learners”. But, how do you foster that in emerging developers? Such that they have sufficient foundational knowledge to build a meaningful career, and that they are provided the tools to continue to bridge knowledge gaps in our ever-changing industry.

    An apprenticeship program helps all your engineers understand your technology platform, culture, and shared vocabulary, so they can meaningfully contribute earlier and better. Learn how to develop and implement a robust apprenticeship program that creates a solid and continuous pipeline of talent that will grow your business. This talk is about learning, how to get started, keep motivated, self-assess, and other useful patterns.

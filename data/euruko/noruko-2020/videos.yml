    In this talk I'll discuss Rubyfmt, a work in progress Ruby autoformatter. Why I'm building it, and how it differs from Rubocop, the closest similar tool that you might be familiar with. I'll get deep in to the weeds on some of the technical challenges of building a system like this, and what the overall goals for the project are.

    Penelope Phippen makes Rubyfmt, and was previously a lead maintainer of the Rspec testing framework. She's been writing Ruby for just about a decade, and still remembers writing Ruby for 1.8.6.

    The humble password is broken. The internet is littered with poor security practices and password breaches, but the world is not ready to go password free yet. So what can we do to protect our users? Let's take a look at how we currently protect passwords, at what we can throw away from those processes and what we can bring in to help strengthen our users' passwords. We'll investigate the tools, practices and APIs that can help us in this endeavour. Together we can move the world from *password1* to *correct horse battery staple* and beyond!

    Phil is a developer evangelist for Twilio and a Google Developer Expert. He's been in the web industry for 10 years building with JavaScript and Ruby. He can be found hanging out at meetups and conferences, playing with new technologies and APIs or writing open source code online. Sometimes he makes his own beer, but he's more likely to be found discovering new ones around the world.

    If you enjoy building projects using TypeScript, you probably wish you could build Ruby projects with a type checker. I've been in that boat! Recently, I stumbled upon Sorbet, a well-maintained type checker for Ruby. In this talk, we'll take a look at how we can use Sorbet.

    Ali Ilman is a software engineer from Malaysia. He works for Suria Labs as a full-stack developer. He writes Ruby and JavaScript and other than these technologies, he's getting his hands dirty with Docker and Kubernetes. He loves TDD and service objects. In his free time, he tends to have his head buried in a book.

    Ruby is known to be "complex language for writing simple code" and "designed to make programmers happy". Yet while those principles are fully embodied in the language spirit and logic, the documentation is traditionally more problematic, especially for newcomers who are already programming-literate and expect a quick and deep dive. Let's talk about several aspects of language and standard library documentation, its history, current state, and the future, expectations it should ideally meet and some unfortunate road bumps.

    Victor Shepelev is an Ukrainian programmer and poet with twelve years of programming experience and fifteen years of Ruby programming. Working at Verbit.ai, mentoring students (including Google Summer of Code-2016-2018, as a mentor for SciRuby organization), developing open source (Ruby Association Grant 2015).

    Have you ever looked at a bug and wondered why it actually happens? It's easy to chalk it up to sloppy coding but that's almost never the case. In this talk we'll be dissecting a exploit from Pokemon Blue known as the "Missingno" glitch. We'll look at the details of each of the seemingly random bugs behind this exploit. We'll look at why these bugs happened, and the lessons we can apply to our Ruby code more than 20 years later.

    Siân Griffin is a former Rails committer, and co-leads the team responsible for crates.io, the package repository for Rust.

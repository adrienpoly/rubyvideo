    In this talk I'll discuss Rubyfmt, a work in progress Ruby autoformatter. Why I'm building it, and how it differs from Rubocop, the closest similar tool that you might be familiar with. I'll get deep in to the weeds on some of the technical challenges of building a system like this, and what the overall goals for the project are.

    Penelope Phippen makes Rubyfmt, and was previously a lead maintainer of the Rspec testing framework. She's been writing Ruby for just about a decade, and still remembers writing Ruby for 1.8.6.

    "The humble password is broken. The internet is littered with poor
    security practices and password breaches, but the world is not ready to go password
    free yet. So what can we do to protect our users? Let's take a look at how we
    currently protect passwords, at what we can throw away from those processes and
    what we can bring in to help strengthen our users' passwords. We'll investigate
    the tools, practices and APIs that can help us in this endeavour. Together we
    can move the world from *password1* to *correct horse battery staple* and beyond!

    "Ruby is known to be \"complex language for writing simple code\" and
    \"designed to make programmers happy\". Yet while those principles are fully embodied
    in the language spirit and logic, the documentation is traditionally more problematic,
    especially for newcomers who are already programming-literate and expect a quick
    and deep dive. Let's talk about several aspects of language and standard library
    documentation, its history, current state, and the future, expectations it should
    ideally meet and some unfortunate road bumps. \n\nVictor Shepelev is an Ukrainian
    programmer and poet with twelve years of programming experience and fifteen years
    of Ruby programming. Working at Verbit.ai, mentoring students (including Google

    Have you ever looked at a bug and wondered why it actually happens? It's easy to chalk it up to sloppy coding but that's almost never the case. In this talk we'll be dissecting a exploit from Pokemon Blue known as the "Missingno" glitch. We'll look at the details of each of the seemingly random bugs behind this exploit. We'll look at why these bugs happened, and the lessons we can apply to our Ruby code more than 20 years later.

    Siân Griffin is a former Rails committer, and co-leads the team responsible for crates.io, the package repository for Rust.

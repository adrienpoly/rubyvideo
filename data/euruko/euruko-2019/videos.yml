    Closing keynote: The Past, Present, and Future of Rails at GitHub


    We'll look at GitHub's story, our Rails upgrade, and how cumulative technical debt can stifle development. At the end we'll explore how we're staying up to date with Rails and our investment in the future of Rails.

    From multiple apps to Monolith - #BuildingMonsterservices

    We are currently transferring our 5 public Rails apps to 1 big monolith. All five of them are job boards with seemingly similar logic but historically grown exceptions and weird peculiarities. The perspective to have multiple data bases managed in 1 app in Rails 6 sparked our idea. The whole story!

    Surrounded by Microservices

    How to architect an app that consumes endless data sources via various different protocols? How to support easy swapping of those data sources and how to test it with confidence? Let's checkout how these and many other requirements are fulfilled within the Netflix Studio space.

    What causes Ruby memory bloat?

    Ruby apps can use a lot of memory. But why? I set out on a journey of discovery, and not only found evidence that defies common wisdom, but also a simple way to reduce memory usage by 70%.

    It's very effective; using Pokemon to catch all code smells

    When learning new skills, connecting what you already know is key. Studying the most common code smells in Ruby and their fixes, exposes a pattern that is similar to how the game mechanic in the popular video game Pokemon works. Grouping certain types and finding the way to beat them.

    How We’re Making Tech Documentation Better, Easier, And Less Boring

    Engineers optimize for scale. We think about writing the “best” code, designing non-flaky tests to give us confidence, and adopting the latest and greatest - but why do we still fail to write, maintain, and improve our docs? Given we all rely on docs, what went wrong?

    Plan towards Ruby 3 Types

    We introduce Ruby Type Profiler which is one of the proposals for Ruby 3’s static analysis. As far as we know, it is only one approach to statically analyze a non-type-annotated program for MRI. We aim to realize a static analysis tool that imposes no change of the great Ruby programming experience.

    Steal this talk

    It’s been a long journey building “Talkie”, but in the process I’ve consumed 100’s of Ruby talks from over the last years and I want to boil them down to the best things I can fit into this time slot. This talk is like a listicle of listicles, a best of Ruby talks. Like if you soaked up all the Ruby talks, cooked them down into a thick paste and then smeared it all over the EuRuKo stage.

We will use this technique with a real-world application to identify a piece of optimizable code in Active Record that leads to a patch with substantial page speed impact.

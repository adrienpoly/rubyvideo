  description: "Renaissance of Ruby on Rails - Ruby on Rails blazed trails in popular
    web application development with Convention Over Configuration, brought a version
    of MVC to the masses. All of this in the beautiful, expressive, and enjoyable
    Ruby programming language.\n\nBut web development moved away. Organisations wanted
    to split their development teams, and add complexity to the process using micro-services,
    bifurcating development teams, and complicating deployments with containerisation.
    Ruby on Rails fell behind the popular curve, and Ruby on Rails entered the Dark
    Ages.\n\nIn this talk, Steven will explore how the latest release of Ruby on Rails
    delivers us out of the Dark Ages, and back into the freedom offered by Full-Stack.
    You will see how, using just what’s built in to Rails, you can deliver highly
    interactive applications, and take advantage of the benefits of containerised
    deployments, without complicating your development and deployment workflows.\n\nLet’s
    celebrate the Renaissance of Ruby on Rails together!\n____________________________________________\n\n►

  description: "Future- Proofing Ruby Gems: Strategies For Long-Term Maintenance \n\nEmbark
    on an advanced journey with Maciej, where he offers a deep dive into the planning
    and foresight required when building Ruby OSS gems. This session transcends typical
    development discussions, focusing on the unique considerations necessary for creating
    open-source software that stands the test of time. Maciej will share insights
    from his experience, highlighting the importance of thoughtful decision-making
    in an environment where a simple fix is not always an option.\n\nAttendees will
    learn how to avoid common pitfalls that lead to long-term issues, understand the
    nuances of building non-standard applications, and gain a new perspective on the
    delicate balance required to create robust, future-proof open-source software.
    This talk is an invitation to think differently about software development, encouraging
    a deep commitment to quality and sustainability in the OSS community.\n____________________________________________\n\n►

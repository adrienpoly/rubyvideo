    Power of Structured Logging in Rails\n\nRails apps can be a black box. Have you
    ever tried to fix a bug where you just can’t understand what’s going on? This
    talk will give you practical steps to improve the observability of your Rails
    app, taking the time to understand and fix defects from hours or days to minutes.
    Rails 8 will bring an exciting new feature: built-in structured logging. This
    talk will delve into the transformative impact of structured logging on fixing
    bugs and saving engineers time. Structured logging, as a cornerstone of observability,
    offers a powerful way to handle logs compared to traditional text-based logs.
    This session will guide you through the nuances of structured logging in Rails,
    demonstrating how it can be used to gain better insights into your application’s
    behavior. This talk will be a practical, technical deep dive into how to make
    structured logging work with an existing Rails app.\n____________________________________________\n\n►

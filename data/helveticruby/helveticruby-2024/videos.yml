    Hotwire has significantly altered the landscape of building interactive web applications with Ruby on Rails, marking a pivotal evolution toward seamless Full-Stack development.

    With the release of Turbo 8, the ecosystem has gained new momentum, influencing how developers approach application design and interaction.

    This session, led by Marco, a core maintainer of Stimulus, StimulusReflex, and CableReady, delves into capabilities introduced with Turbo 8, reevaluating its impact on the whole Rails and Hotwire ecosystem.

  description: Big is better right? Big data, big features, big customers. With those
    big customers comes requests for big acronyms like SAML, SCIM and RBAC. Getting
    those implemented depends on a strong foundation. The boring bits that were glossed
    over when building the company. Users, Accounts, Authorization, Billing… We can
    prevent heartache, tech debt and stress by getting a handle on them early on.
    I’ll talk about how to think about these basics as you go without overthinking
    it so hopefully you spend less time re-building the basics and more time creating
    products that wow people.

    The story begins with a little database transaction. As the days go by, more and more business requirements cause the transaction to grow in size. We soon discover that it isn't a little transaction anymore, and it now poses a serious risk to our application and business. What went wrong, and how can we fix it?

    In this talk, we'll witness a database transaction gradually grow into a liability. We'll uncover some common but problematic patterns that can put our data integrity and database health at risk, and then offer strategies for fixing and preventing these patterns.

    When we think about “accessibility”, most of us associate it with design, HTML, CSS - in other words, the front-end. If you work primarily on the back-end of the tech stack, it’s easy to assume that your role is disengaged from accessibility concerns.

    In fact, there are multiple ways back-end devs can impact accessibility, both for external users and for colleagues.

    In this talk, we’ll walk through everything from APIs to specs to Ruby code to documentation, using examples throughout, to demonstrate how even those of us who rarely touch HTML can positively impact accessibility for all.

    Crystal is a language with a focus on developer happiness, like Ruby. The syntax and OOP model resemble that and any Ruby developer feels right at home.

    It's statically typed and compiles to native code, making it intrinsically type safe and blazingly fast. Built-in type inference makes most type annotations unnecessary, resulting in easy to read and clean code.

    It can be a good asset for performance-critical applications and is very approachable for Rubyists

    Crystal is a joy to work with and having it in your toolbox is an asset, even when writing Ruby code.

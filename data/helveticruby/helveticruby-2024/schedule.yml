          - title: Open Source Pairing and Office Hours
            description: |
              We've booked a room in the Colab co-working space for community members to gather and work together on open source. Some ideas:

                * showcase a library you've been working on,
                * talk about features you'd like to see in a library or framework,
                * collaborate on a bug report,
                * improve documentation,
                * hang out with like-minded individuals even if you don't have an idea what to work on in advance.

              The open source office hours are also an opportunity to meet maintainers from the Ruby ecosystem in person. Ask questions, discuss new ideas, fix bugs together.

              Who will be there?

              * Marco Roth, open source contributor currently focusing on the Hotwire ecosystem
              * Sarah Lima and Dimiter Petrov from thoughtbot
              * Yves Senn, Rails Core team Alumnus
              * Pascal Simon from Puzzle, maintainers of Hitobito

              You! Bring your ideas and questions.

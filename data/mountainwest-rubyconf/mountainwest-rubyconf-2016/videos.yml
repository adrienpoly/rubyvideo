  description: "How to Build a Skyscraper by Ernie Miller \n\nSince 1884, humans have
    been building skyscrapers. This means that we had 6 decades of skyscraper-building
    experience before we started building software (depending on your definition of
    “software”). Maybe there are some lessons we can learn from past experience?\nThis
    talk won’t make you an expert skyscraper-builder, but you might just come away
    with a different perspective on how you build software.\n\nHelp us caption & translate

    Orders of Magnitude by Davy Stevenson

    Up until the 17th century, the world was mostly limited to what we could see with the naked eye. Our understanding of things much smaller and much larger than us was limited. In the past 400 years our worldview has increased enormously, which has led to the advent of technology, space exploration, computers and the internet. However, our brains are ill equipped to handle dealing with numbers at these scales, and attempt to trick us at every turn.
    Software engineers deal with computers every day, and thus we are subject to both incredibly tiny and massively large numbers all the time. Learn about how your brain is fooling you when you are dealing with issues of latency, scalability, and algorithm optimization, so that you can become a better programmer.

    Surviving the Framework Hype Cycle by  Brandon Hays test

    Baskin Robbins wishes it had as many flavors as there are JS frameworks, build tools, and cool new “low-level” languages. You just want to solve a problem, not have a 500-framework bake-off! And how will you know whether you picked the right one? Don’t flip that table, because we’ll use the “hype cycle” and the history of Ruby and Rails as a guide to help you understand which front-end and back-end technologies are a fit for your needs, wants, and career now and in the future.

    Writing a Test Framework From Scratch by Ryan Davis

    Assertions (or expectations) are the most important part of any test framework. How are they written? What happens when one fails? How does a test communicate its results? Past talks have shown how test frameworks work from the very top: how they find, load, select, and run tests. Instead of reading code from the top, we’ll write code from scratch starting with assertions and building up a full test framework. By the end, you’ll know how every square inch of your testing framework works.

    is built on technology that was never meant to work together. Basic features in
    seemingly simple and innocuous technologies, such as XML, resulted in these technologies
    being insecure. In this session we’ll talk about how attackers exploit well known
    vulnerabilities like XSS, XXE, and CSRF and how to make more secure software by
    avoiding similar decisions that resulted in these exploits.\n\nHelp us caption

    of us get a few years into our career and get stuck in a rut. Maybe we stop reading
    about the latest and greatest in tech. Maybe we start managing and do less coding
    than we’d like. Maybe life gets in the way and coding becomes drudgery.\nOne way
    to combat this feeling is to focus on learning. I’ll share what I’ve learned about
    juggling self improvement with being a professional nerd. I’ll talk about the
    courses, tools, books, and other resources I’ve found most useful. You’ll leave
    this talk with several ideas for breaking out of your own developer rut.\n\nHelp

    TDD For Your Soul: Virtue Through Software Development by Abraham Sangh

    Web development pushes us to our limits, not only of cognition, but, perhaps surprisingly, of character. Using the cardinal virtues as a framework, we can see that developers need courage to learn, temperance to prioritize goals, a sense of justice by which to discern obligations, and wisdom to choose our path. By being honest about where we lack virtue, and implementing steps to develop character, we can perform test-driven development on ourselves. This process can help us grow not only as developers, but as human beings.

    The Minimum Viable Conference by Kerri Miller & Jeremy Flores

    Ok, so, if nothing else, we’ve got one thing in common. We like conferences. The two of us like ‘em so much that we recently spent a large chunk of time and money organizing and hosting one, and are planning at least one more for next year, too. Ask us about it!
    We’re here to spill the beans on what it takes to make these things happen. We’ll do our damndest to tell you everything you need to know to get your own conference off the ground. We’ll cover topics like:
    How many people do you need? To attend? To organize?
    Where’s the money come from?
    How do you get sponsors?
    How do you run a CFP?
    What are the easy wins and hard losses?
    For what services do you pay versus those you seek for free?
    How do you protect yourself and your fellow organizers?
    Who buys the beer?
    Whether you’re planning a multi-day conference, a monthly meetup, or just a one-time get-together for your office, we’ll give you a handy list of DOs and DONTs, based on our own experiences and those of others in the community event game. Like Kerri’s Gramma once said, “If you want to go to a party, sometimes you have to throw it yourself.”

    It leaves you paralyzed, unable to do what you need to do, and it strikes without

    take a look at how to recognize, prepare for, and weather burnout, and hopefully
    come through the other side stronger than ever!\n\nHelp us caption & translate

    Schemaless database are a joy to use because they make it easy to iterate on your app, especially early on. The relational model isn't always the best fit for evolving and messy data in the real world. And let's be honest—it's painful to persist rich domain models across millions of little tables. However as your data model stabilizes, the lack of well-defined schemas becomes painful. On the other hand, relational databases are proven, robust, and powerful. How are we supposed to pick one or the other? Simple: pick both.

    Recent advances in Postgres allow for a new hybrid approach. The hstore datatype brings key/value pairs to Postgres, and PLV8 embeds the super-fast V8 JavaScript engine into Postgres. These in turn make Postgres the best document database in the world. This talk will explore when and how to take advantage of them, and how we use these techniques at Heroku.

    All too often programmers get into a productive rhythm where they receive their requirements, write tests aligned to those requirements, and then look for the green and red. While this process is proven to be highly effective, it can lead to developers missing the mark, as they aim for functional completeness and not the polish that an end user requires.

    We should start proposing breakpoints for developers to step away from their automated tests, and play with the features they are working on. It's too easy for developers to get caught up in their process and forget about the end user experience. In this presentation you will learn several techniques for developing for the user experience, even when you're buried in code.

    Devops is a buzzword, but in reduction it means putting the people who are responsible for new features in charge of getting them out there. At Pivotal Labs we work with 30 startups at a time, and have seen what works well and what makes developers cringe and slows down progress. I'd like to convince every developer to start running the sites they work on, embrace change throughout their infrastructure, and give some tips for how to do it along the way.

    On some teams pairing is the norm; developers enjoy the collaboration
    & experience enhanced productivity. Others, though, work on teams where pairing
    is shunned, avoided, or just faked. Why do some craftsmen thrive with pairing
    while others want nothing to do with it? Why does coach- enforced pairing turn
    into something dry, distracted, imbalanced & ineffective? Effective pairing can
    increase creativity, energy, speed & quality. What factors make that possible?
    Learn how to take action on your team to put an end to soul-sucking, miserable,
    fake pair programming, and begin teaching your team to collaborate effectively
    on code.

    Everyone draws inspiration and motivation from different sources.

    For most, it's often frustration.

    We make life decisions, define new features, or refactor code when we get too annoyed by current circumstances. This is where I admit that I have a low tolerance for frustration. Having been frustrated a great deal during my career, I'm going to discuss several anti-patterns that I've seen in code and how to use the Dark Side of the Force (frustration, anger, and rage) to escape from them.

    When you write code, how long is it before that code makes it to production?
    Days? Weeks? Months? LONGER?!?! Deploying code to production multiple times a
    day as automatically as possible will make all your dreams of green grassy meadows
    filled with rainbows and prancing unicorns and ponies come true. Or at least one
    or two of them.

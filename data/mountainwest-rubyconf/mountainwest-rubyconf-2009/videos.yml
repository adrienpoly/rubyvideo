    My good friend Danny Blitz did this presentation at Mountain West Ruby Conference 2009.  It has some really good insights on software development, teams, and life.

    It's with great sadness that I have to tell you that Danny Blitz passed away on August 11, 2012.

    He was a man who had little fear of rejection.  You could sit him down and tell him all the negative things in a given situation and he'd find a way to pick up a positive aspect of it and trumpet the good news.

    He will be missed!

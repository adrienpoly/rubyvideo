    Like many other problems in coding, localization (the art of making your stuff usable and nice to people from various countries and cultures) can seem really easy, until it’s not. Really simple solutions often get you most of the way to what you need, but then the final few complexities turn out to be Hard. I’ve spent a decade working on making localization easier; let me share with you a couple of the projects I’m currently engaged in, and how you can help make the world a little bit more international.

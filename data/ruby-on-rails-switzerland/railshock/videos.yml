  description: |-
    In the US, coding bootcamps currently provide a viable and cheaper alternative to the traditional college- / university-education models. But bootcamps also raise a lot of questions. Do they work in a country like Switzerland where education usually does not come with a price-tag? Is it really possible to get a complete beginner “job ready” within 9 weeks? And what are Software companies expecting when they hire an intern or “junior” developer?

    Should being able to join a company as a full-time dev really be the goal after graduation? Or are we inherently ignoring more favourable outcomes that coding bootcamps can bring?

    During his presentation, Rodrigo will try to shed some light on these questions and talk about the philosophy, personal experiences and insights that went into designing the Master21 curriculum.

    This Railshöck takes place at Impact Hub Zürich (location: Colab at Sihlquai 131, 8005 Zurich): The global community of entrepreneurial people prototyping the future of business. At Impact Hub, you can connect, collaborate, co-work and create great content in an inspiring environment.

    Array and Hash are used in every Ruby program. Yet, current implementations either prevent the use of them in parallel (the global interpreter lock in MRI) or lack thread-safety guarantees (JRuby raises an exception on concurrent Array#<<). Concurrent::Array from concurrent-ruby is thread-safe but prevents parallel access.

    This talk starts with an introduction to show how TruffleRuby works and then shows a technique to make Array and Hash thread-safe while enabling parallel access, with no penalty on single-threaded performance. In short, we keep the most important thread-safety guarantees of the global lock while allowing Ruby to scale up to tens of cores!

    Swiss artists registered on mx3.ch get notified when their songs are played on the radio. How does one get airplay information from arbitrary radio streams? How is it matched against a database of songs?

    In this presentation, we are going to see the challenges encountered while building a production-ready airplay matching system, including:

    * writing a Ruby parser for the Icecast protocol from scratch
    * working around peculiarities in Net::HTTP
    * threading, queues and ActiveRecord connection pools
    * gracefully handling network errors
    * fuzzy matching with PostgreSQL

    Good tests are isolatable, repeatable and deterministic. Good tests don't touch the network and are flexible when it comes to change. Bad tests are all of the above. Bad tests are no tests at all - which is where I found myself with a 5 year legacy codebase running in production and touching millions of customers with minimal use-case documentation. We'll cover this experience and several like it while digging into how to go from zero to total test coverage as painlessly as possible. You will learn how to stay sane in the face of insane testing conditions and how to use these tests to deconstruct a monolith app. When life gives you a big ball of mud, write a big ball of tests.

    "By Coraline Ada Ehmke\n\nAgile companies need timely and reliable
    access to data to make critical business decisions. In the enterprise world, this
    is accomplished with expensive and esoteric data warehousing solutions, while
    younger organizations make do with generic analytics platforms. In this talk I
    will introduce an agile approach to business intelligence that drives decision
    support, feeds data analysis, and delivers flexible reporting capabilities. \n\nWe
    will explore the complete architecture of a lightweight BI system that is used
    in the real world to capture and analyze customer information, monitor user behaviour,
    feed machine-learning algorithms for decision support, and deliver real knowledge
    and value to business stakeholders.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG3P/"

    At Tapjoy we process over a million jobs an hour with Ruby. This talk is a discussion of tools, techniques, and interesting problems from the trenches of scaling up over the last two years. Expect to learn a lot about Ruby job queues (beyond Resque/Sidekiq), performance, concurrency and more.

    "Last year at this very conference John Duff spoke about how Shopify
    scales while maintaing one of the longest lived and largest Rails deployments,
    and how we affront the challenges that come with growth. Shopify in 2013 became
    more than twice the size in every single aspect; requests per minute, GMV, merchants,
    number of developers, etc. \n\nAfter CyberMonday 2012 it became clear that if
    we wanted to survive CyberMonday 2013 we needed to spread the load across more
    than a single huge database, and move to a model of smaller databases to enable
    horizontal scalability. This is the story of how, in 2013, we more than doubled
    the number number of databases that power Shopify, and all the challenges that
    come along when sharding a living, breathing and money producing Ruby application.\n\nHelp

    no accounting for taste. \n\nThe Cobbler's Production Console Has No Shoes. Don't
    give all your great stuff to your end-users, build something nice for yourself
    as well. We'll look at a few of the things I've built for myself at LivingSocial
    and hopefully will inspire you to do the same. \n\nDo-It-Yourself Mocks and Fixtures.
    Big projects need some custom love. factory_girl, ActiveRecord fixtures and mocha
    demo nice, but sometimes they wear out their welcome in a big code base. How hard
    could it be to do yourself? Let's find out! It might be easier than you think.
    \n\nTrack yer Big Stuff without screwing up production with Humperdink. With over
    2500 translation keys in one app, we decided to build out some tooling to track
    at runtime what was and wasn't being used so we could prune out the dead stuff.
    \n\nALL THE ANALOGIES We've all tried to wield the construction analogy to help
    figure out what the heck it is we do. Let's get creative and think of 10 other
    ways that don't quite capture it either.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FG3q/"

    The state of diversity in open source contributions is abysmal. With the number of female OSS contributors at a shockingly low 1.5% and other groups not even documented, we need to ask what we can be doing better as a community. We'll discuss the barriers that people face contributing to our open source projects and what we can do to increase participation.

    Changing code is easy. Changing code with confidence isn't. Even the most robust, mature test suites have blind spots that make large scale changes difficult. At GitHub we use Science to instrument, compare results, and measure performance of parallel code path experiments to see how new code runs against a current production baseline. This talk will show you how to Science, too.

    Getting big things done is important. We praise big accomplishments, but those involved can usually point to the small decisions and actions along the way that made it all possible. Structuring teams, projects, systems, and processes to embrace smallness enables the big things to evolve and succeed. This talk will cover ways in which the teams behind TripCase have succeeded and failed while making big things happen one small step at a time.

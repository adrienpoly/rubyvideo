  description: |-
    With the rise of Javascript MVC frameworks like Ember and Backbone, web programmers find themselves at a fork in the road. If they keep doing server-side web programming, they'll benefit from tried-and-true tools and techniques. If they jump into Javascript MVC, they may be able to offer a more responsive web experience, but at significant added development cost. Which should they choose?

    This talk will address the strategic costs and benefits of using Javascript MVC today. I will touch on subjects such as development speed, usability, conceptual similarities with desktop and mobile applications, the decoupling of rendering and routing from server logic, and the state of the emerging Javascript MVC community. I will also discuss the impact of this seismic change on Ruby, Rails, and your career as a software engineer.

    far less data than traditional methods, invalidate fewer records, improve our
    cache hit rates, and scale to hundreds of thousands of memcache of requests per
    second with a 98% cache hit rate - all while showing users data differently based
    on perspective.

    Most Ruby programmers spend significant time writing, maintaining and troubleshooting automated tests. While recent discussions in the Ruby community have focused on whether we're writing too few or too many tests, this talk looks at how we can write "sensible" tests that allow our applications to deliver the most possible value with the least amount of development time and effort.

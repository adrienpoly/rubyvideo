    Gladiator is a code editor that was built completely in Ruby. It supports syntax highlighting for over 30 programming languages, split pane, file name lookup, a variety of keyboard shortcuts, undo/redo, find and replace, line jumping, monitoring external file system changes, ignoring uneditable files, expanding to fill the screen, running Ruby code, remembering the last open files, and multi-project support. In fact, I have been using Gladiator for all my code editing needs since May of 2020.

    In this talk, I will present Gladiator's features, and then dig into the implementation of every feature in Ruby, covering things like the Model-View-Controller and Model-View-Presenter architectural patterns, how to build custom widgets, how to implement file editing commands, and how to support undo/redo.

    Attendees should walk out of this talk with rudimentary knowledge of how to build a code editor in Ruby.

    There are several view component Ruby gems out there that were created and used by Rails developers in order to decompose application views into view components. Little did they know, Rails already supports view components!!! This talk will explain the various ways Rails already supports view components out of the box. And as part of that, it will demonstrate that the built-in Rails view component options are simpler, more Rails-idiomatic, and more conformant to the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller). As such, they offer higher maintainability and productivity by avoiding the big great evil of Over-Engineering and NIH-Syndrome (Not Invented Here).

    Montreal.rb Ruby Talk 2023/05 - Integrating with REST APIs using Microsoft Kiota - Darrel Miller, Microsoft Graph API Architect, Microsoft & Sébastien Levert, Senior Product Manager, Microsoft

    Your application integration with 3rd party APIs can be difficult if your application platform does not offer SDKs for calling the APIs. Implementation of authentication, authorization, serialization, and exception handling for calling APIs adds a lot of work and risk to your project. Join us for a session filled with demos that showcase how to generate your own personalized SDK client for a complete OpenAPI spec in multiple programming languages with the help of Microsoft Kiota. By using your new personalized client that is generated by Kiota, all the complex aspects of calling APIs get handled for you automatically so that you could concentrate on what really counts: creating value for your end users.

    Software systems require input in order to compute data and produce output. And, one of the ways to provide input to a software system is by uploading a flat file that contains information about various entities (e.g customers or products) in the form of a spreadsheet, following the CSV or XLSX format.

    In order for a software system to properly accept a spreadsheet file as input and effectively process it into output, it usually needs to map spreadsheet columns to entity attributes to store the data in a database. And, often, there is a requirement to validate the data before accepting it (e.g. ensure a column value is within a certain range), and to apply transformations to the data before storing on records in the database. That is in addition to performance, security, usability, and reliability non-functional requirements that ensure that a user could upload a spreadsheet quickly enough while seeing progress indicators in a user-friendly experience and getting their data processed and transformed in the backend without any data loss.

    Enter Flatfile.com! A SAAS product (Software As A Service) that automates the handling of all the concerns and requirements mentioned above and more in a Ruby on Rails web application.

    This talk will provide a brief overview of the Flatfile.com SAAS product features while demonstrating a real world example of using it in a Ruby on Rails web application.

    Matz mentioned in his RubyConf 2022 keynote speech that in the future of Ruby, maybe we could start replacing JavaScript with Ruby in the browser. Especially given that today, we have new options like Ruby WASM and Opal Ruby (Fukuoka Ruby 2023 Winner: https://opalrb.com/blog/2023/03/30/opal-won-fukuoka-ruby-award-for-outstanding-performance/ ), as demonstrated by the TryRuby Playground on Ruby's home page. Using them will achieve the ultimate dream of being able to write Ruby code on both the frontend and backend, resulting in great software engineering benefits such as better code maintainability and higher productivity. That said, how do we get started with Ruby in the browser in a Rails app? What are the trade-offs compared to using JavaScript? How do we make frontend Ruby talk to backend Ruby while reusing some of its Ruby code? This talk will help Ruby on Rails software engineers get started with Ruby in the browser while providing demos along the way via an actual Rails app.

    In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, providing a seamless user experience is paramount. Ruby on Rails has been a steadfast choice for building web applications, but as our applications grow in complexity, so do our views and the challenges associated with them. In this presentation, we'll explore two powerful tools that can significantly improve your Rails views: ViewComponent and Lookbook. By the end of this session, you'll be well-equipped to incorporate ViewComponent and Lookbook into your Rails projects, leveraging generators, slots, collections, and visual design to create more efficient, modular, and visually appealing web applications.

    Rubyists would rather leverage the productivity, readability, and maintainability benefits of Ruby in Frontend Web Development than JavaScript to cut down development cost and time by half compared to using popular yet inferior JavaScript frameworks with bloated JavaScript code as per Matz's suggestion in his RubyConf 2022 keynote speech to replace JavaScript with Ruby. Fortunately, this is possible in 2024!

    This talk is a continuation of the previous Montreal.rb talk "Intro to Ruby in the Browser", which ended by promising a new way in the future for developing Web Frontends that would completely revolutionize the way we think about and do Frontend Development using Ruby instead of JavaScript. The future is now!!! The simplest, most intuitive, most straight-forward, and most productive Frontend Framework in existence is here! It is an open-source Ruby gem called Glimmer DSL for Web.

    Think of Glimmer DSL for Web as the Rails of Frontend Frameworks. With it, you can finally live in Rubyland in both the Frontend and Backend on the Web! That opens up the door to ideas like rendering Frontend Components in the Backend as Server Components in the future, eliminating the conflict between ERB and JS frontend rendering technologies by leveraging highly readable, maintainable, and productive Ruby code isomorphically.

    React Server Components are the next milestone in the React core team's initiative to ease web development (and are the hot new thing!). They aim to greatly improve the user experience by lowering the number of roundtrips necessary between the client and server and by streaming data as soon as it becomes available. However, they are currently only usable in the Next.js framework with a Node backend... But couldn't we mimic what this backend does in Rails and leverage this to modernize React development in Rails?

    In this talk we will explain some of the inner workings of React Server Components, their benefits and how they can be implemented in any backend.

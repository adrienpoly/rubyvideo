    "Sending a method to an object, then discarding its return value immediately" is one of the most frequent operations that ruby does. By eliminating such wastes of time and memory, ruby execution could be much more efficient. I will share you some stories and outcomes of my journey trying to optimise that part.

    We have developed a typesystem for Ruby at Stripe with a goal of helping developers understand code better, write code with more confidence, and detect+prevent significant classes of bugs.

    This talk shares experience of Stripe successfully adopting Sorbet in our codebase which had millions lines of code that were written before the typechecker had been conceived. The talk will describe: - the process used to add typing to existing code; - many tools developed to support this process; - impact of this type system on safety and productivity at Stripe.

    We also have some exciting announcements!
    The talk does not require any previous knowledge of types and should be accessible to a broad audience.

    Static type checking for Ruby is challenging because the language is dynamically typed. What exactly is the source of the difficulty? You might think of duck typing or defime_method? Totally! But not only them are the reason. In fact, only a few lines of typical and innocent looking Ruby code can make type checking much more complicated than you assume.

    This talk is about the difficulties and type system extensions to make the type checking possible. Static type checking is not easy and requires unfamiliar type system features, but we can do that.

    The majority of performance improvements in modern processors are due to increased core count rather than increased instruction execution frequency. To maximise hardware utilization, applications need to use multiple processes and threads. Servers that process discrete requests are a good candidate for both parallelization and concurrency improvements. We discuss different ways in which servers can improve processor utilization and how these different approaches affect application code. We show that fibers require minimal changes to existing application code and are thus a good approach for retrofitting existing systems.

    Ruby interpreter called MRI (Matz Ruby Interpreter) or CRuby is written in C language. Writing an interpreter in C has several advantages, such as performance at early development, extensibility in C language and so on. However, now we have several issues because of writing MRI in C. To overcome this issue, I propose to rewrite some part of MRI in Ruby language with C functions. It will be a base of Ruby 3 (or Ruby 2.7). In this talk, I'll show the issues and how to solve them with writing Ruby, how to write MRI internal in Ruby and how to build an interpreter with Ruby code.

    We propose a type-level abstract interpreter for Ruby 3's static analysis. This interpreter runs normal (i.e., non-type-annotated) Ruby programs in "type" level: each variable has only a type instead of a value. It reports a possible type-error bug, e.g., attempting to call a unknown method or to pass an invalid type argument during the interpretation. By recording all method definitions and calls, it also creates a summary of the program structure in type signature format. This is useful to understand the code, and can be also used as a prototype of type definition for external type checkers.

    Ruby on Rails applications sometimes take too long time in bootstrapping, especially when the application is complicated, monolithic or "legacy" one. This inhibits Kubernetes or other orchestrators to do smooth autoscaling. There are technologies such as bootsnap to solve this problem. In addition to them, I propose new strategy - "checkpoint and restore". I used CRIU(Checkpoint and Restore In Userspace) in Linux environment to make "ahead of time" process dump, and boot the application from image to reduce the bootstrap time. In my case, observed bootstrap time is reduced from about 2,500ms to 1,200ms. I will describe what the CRIU is in the first place, use cases where CRIU is effective and some problems using CRIU.

    Generating code and compiling code are very useful, but usually the target is the machine: so the generated code is very unfriendly for programmers. We will show two approaches with which we are able to compile Ruby to code in statically typed languages and make it idiomatic and nice

    pseudocode-like(where we support small programs in a subset of Ruby, but we can generate correct statically typed code in C++, C#, Go, Java) and

    realcode-like, where we infer ruby types on runtime and autotranslate more complicated codebase to Nim(rb2nim): the result requires some manual work, but automates most of it.

    We have been interpreting the C extensions (and JITing together with Ruby code) for a while, however we have been passing the Ruby objects directly into the C code which had lead to problems. We now have a new innovative technique which no longer requires patches in almost all cases. The objects are wrapped for greater compatibility and there is a virtual GC marking phase to avoid memory leaks.

    The pluck method provided in ActiveRecord is a platform to obtain one or few field values as an array or arrays from a database. The pluck method, compared with finder methods, can considerably reduce memory consumption because it does not generate model instances.

    In this talk, I would like to introduce my new approach to reduce the memory consumption of ActiveRecord. This approach employs Apache Arrow as the internal data representation of an ActiveRecord::Result object. This approach can achieve a remarkable reduction of the memory consumption of the pluck method; it is 2-12x efficient than the original implementation.

    Ruby is historically difficult to optimize due to features that improve flexibility and productivity at the cost of performance. Techniques like Ruby's new JIT compiler and deoptimization code help, but still are limited by techniques like monkey-patching and binding inspection.

    Pre-evaluation is another optimization technique that works based on user-defined contracts and assumptions. Users can opt in to optimizations by limiting their use of Ruby's features and thereby allowing further compiler work.

    In this talk we'll look at how pre-evaluation works, and what benefits it enables.

    JSON is widely used in the current Web. But the request / response format is not in the JSON specification, so we can't guarantee.

    In the case of developing API servers for backend server and multiple servers like micro services, guaranteeing the request / response format is improve for stability and development efficiency. So the definition of schema is important.

    OpenAPI 3 (formerly Swagger) is a specification for describing the interface of RESTful API. We can define request / response parameters schema for the endpoint using it.

    The committee is gem which validates request / response in rack layer. I'm developing the function to perform validation using OpenAPI 3 in this gem. And I shifted my application specification to OpenAPI3 from another schema specification called JSON Hyper-Schema.

    I'll demonstrate, or more precisely, play with Ruby local variables, including a discussion about the following common pitfall:

    eval 'a = 1'
    eval 'p a' # NameError!

    Ruby has multiple different types of variables: global vars, instance vars, class vars, constants, local vars, and pseudo vars such as self. Identifiers without sigils such as @ are considered either local vars, methods, method arguments, block parameters, pseudo variables, or other reserved words. Particularly important aspect I believe is that Ruby intentionally tries to make local vars and methods indistinguishable for human. This talk focuses only on local vars among other variables or methods.

    Keywords: parse.y, binding, yarv iseq, continuation, flip-flop operator, regular expression, and gdb

    Developing large and high load application without monitoring is a hard and dangerous task, just like piloting an aircraft without gauges. Why it is so important to keep an eye on how application's “flight“ goes, what things you should care more, and how graphs may help to resolve occurring performance problems quickly. On an example of Sidekiq, Prometheus, and Grafana, we will learn how to take metrics from the Ruby application, what can we see from their visualization, and I will tell a couple of sad tales about how it helps in everyday life (with happy-end!)

    The second half will be "coming soon"

    Amir Rajan has done something insane. He released a Nintendo Switch game written entirely in mRuby and C. Amir will share his journey with you from the inception of A Dark Room Switch, it's integration with libSDL, all the way to the submission to his publisher. Hopefully, Amir will inspire others to pursue game development projects of their own using Ruby.

    Ruby 3 will ship with a new feature for type checking, RBS. It provides
    a language to describe types of Ruby programs, the type declarations for standard
    library classes, and a set of features to support using and developing type checkers.
    In this talk, I will introduce the feature and how the Ruby programming will be

    Transpiling is a source-to-source compiling. Why might we need it in Ruby? Compatibility and experiments.

    Ruby is evolving fast nowadays. The latest MRI release introduced, for example, the pattern matching syntax. Unfortunately, not everyone is ready to use it yet: gems authors have to support older versions, Ruby implementations are lagging. And it's still experimental, which raises the question: how to evaluate proposals? By backporting them to older Rubies!

    I want to discuss these problems and share the story of the Ruby transpiler — Ruby Next. A decent amount of Ruby hackery is guaranteed.

    As part of our adoption process of Sorbet at Shopify, we needed an automated way to teach Sorbet about our ~400 gem dependencies. We decided to tackle this problem by generating interface files (RBI) for each gem via runtime reflection.

    However, this turns out to not be as simple as it sounds; the flexible nature of Ruby allows gem authors to do many wild things that make this Hard. Come and hear about all the lessons that we learnt about runtime reflection in Ruby while building "tapioca".

    Opal is a compiler convert from Ruby to JavaScript. JavaScript has
    async/await syntax for asynchronous processing. But Opal hasn't implemented it
    yet. The Opal community had been discussed mapping Fiber semantics to JavaScript
    async/await. The conclusion was it is impossible to map coroutine such as Fiber
    because async/await is just a syntax sugar that expresses nested callbacks into
    flat statements. I'm going to talk about the idea I'm trying to incorporate easy-to-use
    asynchronous processing into Opal.

We can record the tough bug using mruby-rr for just once.

But the users still confused the differences standard libraries and default/bundled gems.

    After releasing Ruby 3, We need to learn about the dependency is not only "Versioning" with default gems. It caused by the between library and library over the versioning. For that reason, I need to describe the motivation of "Promoting/Demoting the Default Gems or Bundle Gems" continuously. You will learn the resolution mechanism on RubyGems/Bundler and the standard libraries of the Ruby language with my talk.

    Prettier was created in 2017 and has since seen a meteoric rise within the JavaScript community. It differentiated itself from other code formatters and linters by supporting minimal configuration, eliminating the need for long discussions and arguments by enforcing an opinionated style on its users. That enforcement ended up resonating well, as it allowed developers to get back to work on the more important aspects of their job.

    Since then, it has expanded to support other languages and markup, including Ruby. The Ruby plugin is now in use in dozens of applications around the world, and better formatting is being worked on daily. This talk will give you a high-level overview of prettier and how to wield it in your project. It will also dive into the nitty gritty, showing how the plugin was made and how you can help contribute to its growth. You’ll come away with a better understanding of Ruby syntax, knowledge of a new tool and how it can be used to help your team.

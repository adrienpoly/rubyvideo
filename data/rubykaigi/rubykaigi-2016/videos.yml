    There is a hidden problem waiting as Ruby becomes 3x faster and starts to support parallel computation - reordering by JIT compilers and CPUs.
    In this talk, we’ll start by trying to optimize a few simple Ruby snippets. We’ll play the role of a JIT and a CPU and order operations as the rules of the system allow. Then we add a second thread to the snippets and watch it as it breaks horribly.
    In the second part, we’ll fix the unwanted reorderings by introducing a memory model to Ruby. We’ll discuss in detail how it fixes the snippets and how it can be used to write faster code for parallel execution.

    Strings are used pervasively in Ruby. If we can make them faster, we can make many apps faster.
    In this talk, I will be introducing ropes: an immutable tree-based data structure for implementing strings. While an old idea, ropes provide a new way of looking at string performance and mutability in Ruby. I will describe how we replaced a byte array-oriented string representation with a rope-based one in JRuby+Truffle. Then we’ll look at how moving to ropes affects common string operations, its immediate performance impact, and how ropes can have cascading performance implications for apps.

    Currently many of Ruby's String methods, such as upcase and downcase, are limited to ASCII and ignore the rest of the world. This is finally going to change in Ruby 2.4, where this functionality will be extended to cover full Unicode. You will get to know what will change, how your programs may be affected, and how these changes are implemented behind the scenes. We will also look at the overall state of internationalization functionality in Ruby, and potential future directions.

    A proposal of new concurrency model for Ruby 3
    This presentation proposes a new concurrency model to support parallel execution for Ruby 3.

    Now, Ruby has "Thread" to support concurrency.

    However, making thread-safe programs is very hard because we need to manage all of the concurrent object mutations.

    To overcome such difficulty, we propose a new concurrency model that enables parallel execution.

    This presentation shows the following topics.
    (1) Why is thread programming difficult?

    (2) New concurrent model proposal and why is this model easy?

    (3) Current design and implementation of this idea.

    Ruby has many different web server options, covering a gamut of possible concurrency architectures. We will look at what those concurrency options are, and at what their respective theoretical costs and benefits are.
    We will then look at a reference ruby web server implementation that can have each of these different concurrency architectures plugged into it, and examine how its performance under load varies with each of those architectures.
    We'll wrap it all up with a summary of the results, and a look at which Ruby web servers fall into which categories of concurrency architecture.

    Until recently, we didn't talk much about "legacy Ruby". But today, so many companies rely on Ruby that legacy code is inevitable.
    When code is hard-to-understand, we fear our changes may silently break something. This fear erodes the courage to improve code's design, making future change even harder.
    If we combine proven refactoring techniques with Ruby's flexibility, we can safely add features while gradually improving our design. This talk will draw on code analysis, testing, and object-oriented design to equip attendees with a process for refactoring legacy code without fear.

In the design of Pwrake, I made use of existing powerful tools. First, Pwrake is implemented as an extension to Rake. In this talk, I show that Rake is so powerful that it enables portable definition of workflow DAGs comprised of many tasks. Second, Pwrake has an option to make use of Gfarm distributed file system for high-performance parallel file I/O. Also, I will talk about other studies on Pwrake such as locality-aware task scheduling.

I'll cover some standard definitions of benchmarking in dynamic languages, as well as the tradeoffs that must be made when benchmarking. I'll look at some of the possible benchmarks that could be considered for Ruby 3x3, and evaluate them for what they're good for measuring, and what they're less good for measuring, in order to help the Ruby community decide what the 3x goal is going to be measured against.

    Even after you write correct code, you might want to add some nice features like open and close the cover working with flusher. How do you verify the behavior of it?
    State machine diagram is usually used to verify the behavior, especially for embedded systems.

    In UML 2.x, nested states and orthogonal regions are supported to describe complex behaviors.

    Through the diagrams, you can learn what is "good" design for controlling devices.

    In addition, Ruby lets us convert the diagrams into executable code easily.

    Unicorn is the most used multiprocess server framework implemented in ruby. But it doesn't work on Windows unfortunately.

    Serverengine is a robust multiprocess server implemented in ruby and it works on windows now. This is the first multiprocess server with ruby which can work on windows.
    I'll talk about what only ruby can do and my original effort for realizing a robust multiprocess server for restricted environment.

    And in the end, I'll introduce real demos on windows.

    "http://rubykaigi.org/2016/presentations/youchan.html\n\nLast year
    at RubyKaigi, I introduced Hyalite, a virtual DOM implemented in Ruby. \nHyalite
    allows Rubyists to write front and back-end code in Ruby, an approach that has
    proven to provide many benefits. Using a single language across an application
    stack is sometimes referred to as isomorphic programming. \nThis talk introduces
    a new framework for isomorphic programming with the Opal: Menilite. \nMenilite
    shares model code between the server side and the client side by marshalling objects
    and storing them in the database automatically. \nAs a result, code duplication
    is reduced and APIs are no longer a necessity. \nIsomorphic programming can significantly
    accelerate your progress on a project; I sincerely hope you find it helpful in
    developing web applications. \nMenilite aims to expand the playing field for the
    Ruby language, a language optimized for developer happiness. I'm sure you will
    agree that we will find even more happiness by bringing Ruby to the front-end
    as well.\n\nYoh Osaki, @youchan\nSoftware engineer at Ubiregi inc. Author of Hyalite

    Fluentd v0.14, which has drastically updated Plugin APIs, also has a layer to provide compatibility for old-fashioned plugins to support them and huge amount of existing configuration files in user environments.

    It was far from easy, and developers had to do everything possible, including any kind of black magics.
    This talk will show some stories with code and commits of a software used in real world:
    * How to provide compatibility between different APIs
    * How to provide required methods on existing objects
    * How to make sure to call super for existing methods without super

    I using mruby and OpenFrameworks to create a scriptable GLSL generator to create shader. By the power of Ruby DSL, the shader generate becomes very fun and simplely.

    Domain-Specific Language(DSL) is a useful tool for communication between programmers and businesses. One of the greatest present from Ruby to programmers is to allow them to develop DSL easily. Ruby has a variety of functionalities for DSL making.
    I started to maintain Rake last year. I found interesting techniques in Rake and felt different things on other popular DSLs like rspec examples, rails routes, and thor tasks etc. And I found patterns of code for DSL with Ruby.
    I’m going to try to improve Rake 12 using these patterns. So I will describe these patterns of code for DSL with Ruby and talk on the future of Rake 12.

    Released in 1989 the Gameboy was the first handheld console of the Gameboy series to be released by Nintendo. It featured games such as Pokemon Red & Blue, Tetris, Super Mario Land and went on to sell 64 million units worldwide.
    My talk will be discussing what components make up a Gameboy, such as the CPU, RAM, Graphics and Game Cartridge. How each component works individually and how they work together to let trainers catch em all. Then how to replicate the behavior of the Gameboy in code to eventually make an emulator.

    mruby and mruby-cli makes it possible to ship single binary command-line tools that can be used without setup effort. How can we make these easy to write too?
    Existing libraries for making command-line tools are built for experienced rubyists. This makes them a poor choice for porting to mruby.
    In this talk we'll explore how to build a command-line tool with mruby-cli along with a design and philosophy that makes it easy to create new commands and maintain existing commands even for unfamiliar developers.

    Ruby is used everywhere now. In this talk we will compare Ruby concurrency with Node.js, JVM, Erlang and others.
    Ruby supports concurrency but with GIL, it can't run threads parallely. We will explore options available that makes this problem irrelevant.
    Node.js doesn’t support concurrency or parallelism. Node.js is single threaded. It runs an event loop which makes non blocking IO possible. We will explore why Node.js fits well to only certain types of problems only
    JVM supports native threads and can do parallelism. But in JVM memory is still shared among different objects. We will explore JVM architecture in regards with memory. Where JVM gets it wrong.
    Erlang/Elixir achieves concurrency and parallelism with shared nothing, immutable data, first class processes, actor model. We will explore whether this approach is better for solving every kind of problem.
    Talk will have deep comparison with all of these platforms in regards with what most real world project need,

    Good news! Ruby is a successful and mature programming language with a wealth of libraries and legacy applications that have been contributed to for many years. The bad news: Those projects might contain a large amount of useless, unused code which adds needless complexity and confuses new developers. In this talk I'll explain how to build a static analysis tool to help you clear out the cruft - because there's no code that's easier to maintain than no code at all!

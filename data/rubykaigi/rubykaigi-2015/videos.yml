    Developer happiness is what brought me to Ruby in the first place. And of all the new compiled languages, Crystal is the only one that shares this value. The syntax and idioms are entirely Ruby inspired.

    Although Crystal looks very similar to Ruby, there are big differences between the two. Crystal is statically typed and dispatched. While there are no runtime dynamic features, the compile-time macros solve many of the same problems.

    In this session, we’ll take a close look at these differences as well as the similarities, and what Ruby developers can learn from this exciting language.

    "Metaprogramming is a powerful technique that sets Ruby apart from other contemporary languages. It allows compact and elegant solutions to seemingly intractable problems. Serving as the foundation of some of the mostly widely used frameworks and DSLs in the Ruby ecosystem, it’s arguably the single most defining feature of Ruby. Unfortunately, that expressive power has traditionally come at the expense of performance.

    We’ll show you how JRuby+Truffle has eliminated the cost of metaprogramming so Rubyists can write idiomatic Ruby without having to worry about hidden performance trade-offs."

    Ruby (MRI) 2.2 compiles Ruby scripts into bytecode (instruction sequences) at run time. This approach is simple, but has several problems such as overhead of compile time. We are working on making an Ahead of Time compiler which compiles Ruby script before executing the script. This compiler will help to reduce boot time and to reduce memory consumption on multiple Ruby processes. In this presentation, we will introduce the compiler and that mechanism.

    Ruby is not the fastest language in the world, there is no doubt about it. This doesn't turn out to matter all that much – Ruby and its ecosystem has so much more to offer, making it a worthwhile tradeoff a lot of the times.

    However, you might occasionally encounter workloads that are simply not suitable for Ruby. In this talk, we will explore building a native extension with Rust to speed up parts of Rails. (No prior experience with Rust required!) What does Rust has to offer in this scenario over plain-old C? Let's find out!

    Most applications written in Ruby are great, but also exists evil code applying WOP techniques. There are many workarounds in several programming languages, but in Ruby, when it happens, the proportion is bigger. It's very easy to write Ruby code with collateral damage.

    You will see a collection of bad Ruby codes, with a description of how these codes affected negatively their applications and the solutions to fix and avoid them. Long classes, coupling, misapplication of OO, illegible code, tangled flows, naming issues and other things you can ever imagine are examples what you'll get.

    Whenever you make a typo on Google or a git … cmd, they’ll automagically correct it for you. It’s great, but have you ever wondered why programming languages don’t have such a cool feature? The next major version of Ruby will! The did_you_mean gem was built to add on a “Did you mean?” experience and Ruby 2.3 will ship with it.

    So what does the whole story look like? How can you use it in your app or gem? How does it correct typos? What even is a typo?

    Let's learn how to take advantage of this new feature in Ruby 2.3 and save ourselves from typos forever!

    Building tools for everyone can be difficult, because of conflicting environment or OS.

    How can we build command-line apps that work for everyone and still write Ruby?

    This talk will discuss how to use mruby-cli to build cross-platform apps in Ruby.

    Our goal will be to build a CLI app using mruby and produce a self-contained binary that can be shipped to end users.

    Since mruby is designed to be embedded and statically compiled, it's also really good at packaging ruby code.

    There are so many testing frameworks available to us that we sometimes overlook a completely valid, and sometimes preferable option: writing our own.

    The drivers team at MongoDB focused over the last year on conforming to common APIs and algorithms but we needed a way to validate our consistency. We therefore ended up building our own testing DSL, REST service, and individual test frameworks.

    Using these common tests and the Ruby driver's test suite as examples, this talk will demonstrate when existing test frameworks aren't the best choice and show how you can build your own.

    a test suite like many libraries and frameworks, written in Ruby. But, It's different
    from typical ruby libraries. Therefore many Rubyists don't know how to run the
    CRuby test suite. \nThis is because CRuby's test suite has historical and complex
    structures. In this talk, I explain the details of the CRuby test suite and protips
    for CRuby's testing technology."

    Web apps are great and everything, but imagine using Ruby to fly drones and make them dance to the sounds of dubstep! Or to control disco lights and other robots! Sounds fun, right? In this talk, we will not only explore how we can write code to make this possible, but it will also be full of exciting, interactive (and possibly dangerous ;) ) demos!

    The news is everywhere: some weird disease makes the dead walking. We do not know yet if it is highly contagious. What should we do? What we do everyday: writing code.

    This couldn't be a better moment to use an agent based model — a technique that simulates interactions between agents in a environment to understand their effects as a whole. For such, we'll visit its minimal Ruby implementation, address some common design, simulate the Zombie epidemic, visualize it, and test different survival strategies to hopefully find the best one.

    We can code, we'll be prepared ... or not.

    How is it improved in the latest release, Ruby 2.2.3? Now can we use an implementation

    This talk describes the architecture of data analytics platform service of Treasure Data, what we use Ruby/JRuby for and what we don't use Ruby for. We will discuss the many reasons, not only for productivity and performance.

    Data analytics platform architecture is very far from well-known web service architecture. There are huge scale queues, workers, schedulers and distributed processing clusters, besides well-known parts like web application servers written in RoR and RDBMSs.

    JRuby 9000 is here! After years of work, JRuby now supports Ruby 2.2 and ships with a redesigned optimizing runtime. The first update release improved performance and compatibility, and we've only just begun. In this talk we'll show you where we stand today and cover upcoming work that will keep JRuby moving forward: profiling, inlining, unboxing...oh my!

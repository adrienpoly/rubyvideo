    Valencia.rb is being re-launched after a nearly 5 years hiatus.

    Our re-launch event couldn't be better! The Ruby Europe initiative has given us the motivation we needed to start talking again about the language we’re so passionate about: Ruby.

    At our next meeting, we are pleased to have Rosa Gutiérrez, a programmer at 37Signals, and [Yauhen Karatkou], Barcelona.rb organizer and Lead Ruby Developer at Tripledot Studios.

    We also have the support of New Work Valencia who will let us meet in their offices.

    We’ll see you on December 11th

    You can’t miss it!

        We've used Resque and Redis to run background jobs in multiple apps for many years at 37signals. However, performance, reliability, and our own apps’ idiosyncrasies led us to use a lot of different gems, some developed by us, some forked or patched to address our struggles.

        After multiple war stories with background jobs, looking at our increasingly complex setup, we wanted something we could use out-of-the-box without having to port our collection of hacks to every new app and with fewer moving pieces.

        After exploring existing alternatives, we decided to build our own and aim to make it the default for Rails 8.

        In this talk, I’ll present Solid Queue, explain some of the problems we had over the years, how we designed Solid Queue to address them, and all the Fun™ we had doing that.

    Ignacio Huerta will explain how a bug report became an unfathomable mystery. In this talk, we will live a debugging adventure with FIDO, Ruby and OpenSSL. Ignacio will share with everyone stories about encryption peculiarities, lessons learned “the hard way” and key insights about the use of Ruby applied to manage “in-car” payments for a major automotive company.

    On this occasion we have the support of Flywire Valencia that kindly lends us the space to meet and have a good time in community.

    See you on Wednesday, February 5th!

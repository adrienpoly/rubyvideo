    to bring REST to developers, but its conception leaves the REST devotee feeling
    a bit empty. \"Where's the hypermedia?\" she says. \"REST isn't RPC,\" he may
    cry. \"WTF??!?!\" you may think. \"I have it right there! resources :posts ! What
    more is there? RPC? Huh?\" \r\n\r\nIn this talk, Steve will explain how to design
    your APIs so that they truly embrace the web and HTTP. Just as there's an impedance
    mismatch between our databases, our ORMs, and our models, there's an equal mismatch
    between our applications, our APIs, and our clients. Pros and cons of this approach
    will be discussed, as well as why we aren't building things this way yet."

    use Rails for their everyday projects. Often they toy around with front-end themselves
    or outsource it, ending up tangled in a web of css-all-over-the-place.\r\n\r\nKeeping
    your front-end code clean is hard. Before you know it you're suffering from CSS
    specificity issues and not-really-generic partials. Find out how to keep things
    tidy using the HTML5 document outline and modular Sass & CoffeeScript, for truly
    reusable code."

    Design is all about having the same content visible in all devices, from tiny
    mobiles to huge monitors, preserving proper readability and adapting to the medium.
    It also entails a new way of creating content, in which interaction between designers
    and programmers is more important. In the Ruby world programmers generally feel
    proud of being \"agile\", however when you zoom out, you see that the interaction
    between designers and programmers is more waterfally than you'd want.\r\n\r\nIn
    the talk I will present the concept of responsiveness and teach with examples
    how to make a layout responsive with the one-two punch of fluid layouts and media
    queries."

    Technology is moving forward... Command line tools are becoming obsolete... Programmers
    today don't need to touch type... Using mouse to copy and paste is perfectly fine...
    You can always look up those design patterns on the web... Your IDE can do a lot
    of things for you so you don't need to think... Can you feel that? Can you feel
    that this is TRUE? Then stop being UNPROFESSIONAL and think again! \r\n\r\nIn
    this talk I'm gonna convince you that learning seemingly obsolete skills can have
    huge impact on your productivity. I'll show you how those skills and other seemingly
    unimportant factors can impact your career. I will help you to find a way to improve
    them in order to become a better programmer. I'll also show you tools that can
    facilitate this process. You will either leave this talk with strong resolution
    to level up, or curl up in your comfort zone with your lovely mouse and IDE. I
    will show you how PROGRAMMERS WORK OUT."

    In our talk we share some of the most interesting, absurd, or funny insights and moments we experienced in our past couple of years. As developers and business founders, we present the best of our own mistakes and show you how we got out of the pits we fell into. Believe us, we've been there as well and, hopefully, attending our talk will help you not making the mistakes we already made for you ;) It will be serious fun! The talk will cover both technical and other subjects.

    from Uncle Bob's architecture talk and Avdi Grimm's upcoming 'Objects on Rails'
    book to the proliferation of (competing? complementing?) database systems, it
    seems the time has come to seriously consider decoupling our objects' persistence
    from the rest of the application. \r\n\r\nThis talk -- after describing the general
    vices of strong object/database coupling and the all-too-usual rails g model-driven
    development -- covers the various approaches to separating the objects' persistence
    layer, along with their virtues (cleaner, simpler tests! backend independence!
    no RDBMS-related shortcuts impacting the design!) and potential vices (performance?
    perceived compexity? YAGNI?)."

    programming, there is a well-known anti-pattern called 'Fear of Adding Classes'.
    It describes the fear of solving a problem by adding another class because of
    the (often wrongfully) perceived added complexity. With systems moving towards
    a distributed nature through the usage of external services, a similar pattern
    can be seen: the fear of adding dedicated components, mostly independent processes
    to the system, because of the fear of added management overhead through doing
    so."

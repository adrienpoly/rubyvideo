    Monoliths Between Microservices by Vladimir Dementyev

    "Rails applications tend to turn into giant monoliths. Keeping the codebase maintainable usually requires architectural changes. Microservices? A distributed monolith is still a monolith. What about breaking the code into pieces and rebuild a monolithic puzzle out of them?

    In Rails, we have the right tool for the job: engines. With engines, you can break your application into components—the same way as Rails combines all its parts, which are engines, too.

    This path is full of snares and pitfalls. Let me be your guide in this journey and share the story of a monolith engine-ification."

    Keynote: Technically, a Talk by Eileen M. Uchitelle

    "Peer deep into Rails’ database handling and you may find the code overly complex, hard to follow, and full of technical debt. On the surface you’re right - it is complex, but that complexity represents the strong foundation that keeps your applications simple and focused on your product code. In this talk we’ll look at how to use multiple databases, the beauty (and horror) of Rails connection management, and why we built this feature for you.

    If you replaced ActionController with an implementation of your own, what would you have to build to get your app working again? In this talk, we'll do just that. We'll see how the controller interacts with the router to receive a request, process it, and return a response. We'll also rebuild controller features like Params, Controller Callbacks, and Rendering. In the end, we'll have a new functioning controller class called AwesomeController, and we will have seen what it takes to process a request in Rails.

    Deeper Understanding & Better Communication through Art by Anna Rankin

    "Understanding new concepts and complex systems is hard. Explaining them? That’s even harder.

As a former illustrator and graphic designer, has found that visual art can be the key to both deeper understanding and clearer, more accessible communication. In this talk, we’ll explore why the ability to clearly communicate is so vital to mastering a complex topic, how to choose the right abstractions to present to a specific audience, and how a different medium can provide a new lens through which to view a familiar topic."

    Peeling Away the Layers of the Network Stack by Ufuk Kayserilioglu

    "As Rails developers, we depend on network protocols to ensure the products we build are available and accessible to our users. Despite this, many of us are poorly aware of how the layers of the network stack actually work, or why they are there.

    Understanding the things that happen between physical signals on the wire and your Rails application will help you hone your craft and level you up. Fortunately, the basic concepts of network protocols are easy to grasp, with a little guidance. So let's walk together through these concepts, and peel away the layers of the network stack one by one."

    Inoculating Rails Auth Against Bug Bounty Hunters by Jason Meller

    You’ve rolled up your sleeves and built the most secure custom auth ever conceived by a dev team. Suddenly, your CTO informs you that your app will be participating in the Org's new Bug Bounty program. Terror fills your heart as you imagine security experts making mince-meat of your beautiful auth system. If only you knew their game plan... Kolide’s CEO, Jason Meller has been rolling his own Rails auth for over a decade and has the bug bounty receipts to prove it. In this talk, he will walk you through Kolide's actual bounty reports so you can level up your team’s auth system.

    Mistakes Were Made by Jesse Spevack

    We picked the wrong technology. We worked in silos. We prematurely optimized. We introduced too many changes at once. And yet somehow we delivered a system that is integral to a shopping rewards app used by millions across the United States. I want to tell you the story of how the best of intentions led to crucial blunders. In this public, honest, and vulnerable post-mortem I will share the missteps I made so that you can avoid them.

    Encapsulating Views by Joel Hawksley

    Unlike models and controllers, Rails views are not encapsulated. This makes them hard to reason about and difficult to test, leading us to use abstractions such as presenters and decorators. In this talk, we'll explore the inner workings of how Rails compiles and executes views today, the lessons we've learned building encapsulated views at GitHub over the past year, and how you can do the same with the support for 3rd-party component frameworks coming in Rails 6.1.

    This breathtaking documentary series combines rare action, unimaginable scale, impossible locations and intimate moments captured from the deepest depths of Rails internals. Last year, we followed the lifecycle of best loved, wildest and most elusive Rails components through a request, from the browser to a controller action. This year, our journey takes us across the great text/plain, following the flow of HTTP streams, taking in the spectacular Action View as we find our way back to the browser. Join us to unearth the amazing lifecycle of a Rails response.

    Alternatively, we can use Rubocop to codify some best practices or common traps to avoid. This talk will dive into how Rubocop can be used to not only enforce styling but also keep problematic patterns out, while also providing the motivation and context for enforcing it."

    Can ActiveStorage Serve Images for the Modern Web? by Mark Hutter

    "It’s a simple question: can ActiveStorage be used for image serving in your modern web apps? The answer is not so simple. Can it handle the speed requirements and size specifications of images that the modern web browsers deems as “fast”?

    We’ll look at the out-of-the-box approach ActiveStorage takes on asset serving, where it works well - resizing, usability, and security, and where we run into rough edges - image load times, CDN integration, and next gen image format storage. And then we’ll look at one pattern working in production today."

    Mentorship is a great way for a newer developer to benefit from the experience of a more senior developer. While there are lots of available resources on how to be a good mentor or mentee, there are far fewer guidelines on how to set up a mentoring program within your engineering organization. I'm doing this now, and I'll share the process with you: why we decided to start a team-wide mentorship program, how we got volunteers and how we matched them, and how we followed up and what worked and what didn't.

    When we built our single sign-on service, we learned that syncing identity changes among applications can be deceptively complex. This is because we had to iteratively deploy the SSO service while supporting our existing applications that used the service. In this talk, we discuss lessons learned and recommendations on three key identity sync problems: 1) using editable fields such as email as an ID, 2) relying on unproven promises by standards such as SCIM, and 3) split-tenant situation. This talk will help developers avoid some pitfalls while building or working with an identity service.

    How does the Webpacker gem provide "it-just-works" webpack integration with Rails? That simplicity did not come easily. The rich functionality, complexity, and rapid evolution of the webpack ecosystem necessitated extension points beyond a simple Ruby config file.

    Yet you need to know almost nothing about webpack to leverage the modern JavaScript ecosystem. But what if you want to extend the standard configuration? What information might help you upgrade webpack and webpacker in the future?

    This talk will explain the magical plumbing of Webpacker so you can leverage the webpack ecosystem on your terms.

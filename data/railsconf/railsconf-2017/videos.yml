    RailsConf 2017: The Art & Craft of Secrets: Using the Cryptographic Toolbox by Michael  Swieton

    Picking an encryption algorithm is like choosing a lock for your door. Some are better than others - but there's more to keeping burglars out of your house (or web site) than just the door lock. This talk will review what the crypto tools are and how they fit together with our frameworks to provide trust and privacy for our applications. We'll look under the hood of websites like Facebook, at game-changing exploits like Firesheep, and at how tools from our application layer (Rails,) our protocol layer (HTTP,) and our transport layer (TLS) combine build user-visible features like single sign-on.

    RailsConf 2017: Why Software Engineers Disagree About Everything by Haseeb Qureshi

    Why are there are so many disagreements in software? Why don’t we all converge on the same beliefs or technologies? It might sound obvious that people shouldn't agree, but I want to convince you it’s weird that we don't. This talk will be a philosophical exploration of how knowledge converges within subcultures, as I explore this question through the worlds of software, online fraud, and poker.

    RailsConf 2017: Building Rails ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase Framework by Eileen Uchitelle

    At the 2014 RailsConf DHH declared system testing would be added to Rails. Three years later, Rails 5.1 makes good on that promise by introducing a new testing framework: ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase. The feature brings system testing to Rails with zero application configuration by adding Capybara integration. After a demonstration of the new framework, we'll walk through what's uniquely involved with building OSS features & how the architecture follows the Rails Doctrine. We'll take a rare look at what it takes to build a major feature for Rails, including goals, design decisions, & roadblocks.

    RailsConf 2017: Perusing the Rails Source Code - A Beginners Guide by Alex Kitchens

    Open source projects like Rails are intimidating, especially as a beginner. It’s hard to look at the code and know what it does. But Ruby on Rails is more than just code. Written into it are years of research, discussions, and motivations. Also written into it are bugs, typos, and all of the pieces that make the code human. This talk outlines steps you can take to explore the inner workings of Rails and gain context on its design. Understanding how Rails works will allow you to write better Rails applications and better Ruby code. You will leave with many resources and tips on perusing Rails.

    RSpec gives you many ways to test your Rails app. Controller, view, model, and so on. Often, it's not clear which to use. In this talk, you'll get some practical advice to improve your testing by understanding how RSpec integrates with Rails. To do this we'll look through some real world RSpec bugs, and with each one, clarify our understanding of the boundaries between RSpec and Rails.

    If you're looking to level up your testing, understand RSpec's internals a little better, or improve your Rails knowledge, this talk will have something for you. Some knowledge of RSpec's test types will be assumed.

We can implement security best practices to protect our user’s personal identifiable information from harm. We each have the power and duty to be a force for good.

    Security is a moving target and a full team effort, so whether you are a beginner or senior level Rails developer, this talk will cover important measures and resources to make sure your Rails app is best secured.

    RailsConf 2017: Rough to Fine: Programming Lessons from Woodworking by Mark Simoneau

    Woodworking has experienced quite a renaissance as of late, and a very popular style involves using power tools for rough work and hand tools for detail and precision work. Using both defines each woodworker's speed and ability to produce beautiful/functional pieces. The same can be true of developers. Automation, convention, powerful IDEs, generators and libraries can make each developer go from nothing to something very quickly, but what about diving deeper to get the precision, performance and beauty you need out of your applications? Come find out.

    The attempted rewrite is over, the dust has settled, and the monolith isn’t going away. After all, it’s still the app that makes all the money. On the other hand, nobody wants to work on it, every new feature takes forever, and your entire team is afraid of making any change for fear of the whole thing collapsing in on itself.

    In this session, we’ll walk through some of the technical and social problems that arise from difficult codebases. We’ll learn to stop making things worse, to measure what we need to change, and start making progress.

    In the thousand mile journey, here are the first steps.

    Help! Despite following refactoring patterns by the book, your aging codebase is messier than ever. If only you had a key architectural insight to cut through the noise.

    Today, we'll move beyond prescriptive recipes and learn how to run a Context Mapping exercise. This strategic design tool helps you discover domain-specific system boundaries, leading to highly-cohesive and loosely-coupled outcomes. With code samples from real production code, we'll look at a domain-oriented approach to organizing code in a Rails codebase, applying incremental refactoring steps to build stable, lasting systems!

We often romanticize leaving our current architecture situation because we believe it will cure what ails us. However, architecture certainly has no silver bullet . Beam up with me as we explore the past, present, and future of reconsidering architecture.

    As systems get more complex they inevitably fail. Many of those failures are preventable.

    We’re not lazy, stupid, or careless. The complexity of our systems simply exceeds our cognitive abilities. Thankfully, we’re not alone. People have successfully managed complex systems long before software came along.

    In this session, we’ll see how surgeons, pilots, and builders have developed techniques to safely manage increasingly complex systems in life and death situations. We will learn how simple checklists improve communication, reduce preventable errors, and drive faster recovery time.

    The ideal workplace, with motivated employees, supportive managers and a clear vision in the "C-suite", is where we'd all like to work, isn't it? The question then, is, how do we create it? How do managers walk the fine line of "micromanaging" and "anarchy"? How can we, as employees, maximize our contribution to our company and love what we do at the same time?

    The secret is in the big band.

    Inspired by Max Dupree's Leadership Jazz, this talk will show you how to apply the principles of improvisation to your company/team and make your workplace more efficient, effective and fun!

    RailsConf 2017: The Good Bad Bug: Learning to Embrace Mistakes by Jess Rudder

    The history of programming is filled with examples of bugs that actually turned out to be features and limitations that pushed developers to make an even more interesting product. We’ll journey through code that was so ‘bad’ it was actually good. Then we’ll learn to tame our inner perfectionists so our code will be even better than it is today.

    RailsConf 2017: Understanding ‘Spoon Theory’ and Preventing Burnout by Jameson Hampton

    Spoon theory is a metaphor about the finite energy we each have to do things in a day. While a healthy, advantaged person may not have to worry about running out of ‘spoons,’ people with chronic illnesses or disabilities and members of marginalized communities often have to consider how they must ration their energy in order to get through the day. Understanding how 'spoons' can affect the lives of your developers and teammates can help companies lessen the everyday burdens on their underrepresented employees, leaving them more spoons to do their best work, avoid burnout and lead fulfilling lives.

    RailsConf 2017: To Code Is Human by Don Werve

    Programming is a deeply mental art. As programmers, we invest large amounts of time in mastering new languages, new techniques, and new tools. But all too often, we neglect our understanding of the most important tool in the developer's toolbox: the programmer's brain itself.

    In this talk, we will combine the art of programming with the science of cognitive psychology, and emerge with a deeper understanding of how to leverage the limits of the human mind to sustainably craft software that is less buggy, easier to understand, and more adaptive in the face of change.

    The average American worker will have 10 jobs before the age of 40. There's a great deal of opportunity and mobility in our industry, and yet, our hiring process is anything but pleasant or streamlined. The hiring process is time consuming for both candidates and employers, but we can do better! Let's explore the ways we can improve the hiring process by writing better job descriptions, utilizing systems that free us from unconscious biases, focusing beyond culture fit, and using better (more fun) technical interviewing methods.

    Steve Jobs. Linus Torvalds. Alan Turing.

    Been there, done that.

    The interesting stories often aren’t the ones we grew up with; they’re the ones we’ve left behind. When it comes to tech, that means its women, and especially its women of color. And while there’s been a greater emphasis lately on rediscovering women’s contributions to technology, we need to expand our focus beyond just Grace Hopper and Ada Lovelace.

    From Radia Perlman to Sophie Wilson to Erica Baker, let's explore both tech’s forgotten heroes and its modern-day pioneers, and help end the silent erasure of women in technology.

    In this talk we'll see how we can leverage Kafka to build and painlessly scale an analytics pipeline. We'll talk about Kafka's unique properties that make this possible, and we'll go through a full demo application step by step. At the end of the talk you'll have a good idea of when and how to get started with Kafka yourself.

    Bernie Sanders popularized crowdfunding in politics by raising $220 million in small donations.

    An example of the challenges with handling a high volume of donations is the 2016 New Hampshire primary night, when Sanders asked a national TV audience to donate $27. Traffic peaked at 300K requests/min and 42 credit card transactions/sec.

    ActBlue is the company behind the service used not only by Sanders, but also 16,600 other political organizations and charities for the past 12 years.

    This presentation is about the lessons we learned building a high performance fundraising platform in Rails.

Turns out, we can adapt a bunch of practices we already use! Using a collaboration between a nonprofit and a civic group as a case study, we'll talk about ways to apply best practices from community organizers to our work. In particular, we'll talk about similarities between contemporary organizing and agile models, ways to build relationships with other team members, and making our work more sustainable.

    Before programming, before formal probability there was Bayes. He introduced the notion that multiple uncertain estimates which are related could be combined to form a more certain estimate. It turns out that this extremely simple idea has a profound impact on how we write programs and how we can think about life. The applications range from machine learning and robotics to determining cancer treatments. In this talk we'll take an in depth look at Bayses rule and how it can be applied to solve problems in programming and beyond.

    For some, making web applications accessible is a must; Government websites fall under Section 508 and retail sites need to reduce legal risk.

    But for others it seems like a luxury; Consultants are expensive, and so are the developer hours spent trying to parse the notoriously hard-to-read WCAG 2.0 docs.

    There is an easier way to start!

    In this session, we will demystify the WCAG 2.0 basics. We’ll use Chrome Accessibility Dev Tools to discover and fix common issues. You will leave with a set of free and easy-to-use resources to start improving the accessibility of your application today.

    Once upon a time, Goldilocks had a couple extra minutes to spare before morning standup. She logged into Github and saw that there were three pull requests waiting for her to review.

    We've probably all heard that peer code reviews can do wonders to a codebase. But not all type of code reviews are effective. Some of them seem to go on and on forever, while others pick at syntax and formatting but miss bugs. This talk explores what makes a strong code review and what makes a painful one. Join Goldilocks as she seeks to find a code review process that's neither too long nor too short, but just right!

    RailsConf 2017: Predicting Titanic Survivors with Machine Learning by Ju Liu

    What's a better way to understand machine learning than a practical example? And who hasn't watched the 1997 classic with Jack and Rose? In this talk we will first take a look at some real historical data of the event. Then we will use amazing Python libraries to live code several of the most well known algorithms. This will help us understand some fundamental concepts of how machine learning works. When we're done, you should have a good mental framework to make sense of it in the modern world.

    Board games are great, but who has time to keep track of what's going on when you just want to have fun? In the spirit of over-engineering we'll look at PitchCar -- probably one of the simplest games in the world -- and see how far we can go with web tech, image processing, and a bunch of math. Expect to see plenty of code, some surprising problems and solutions, and of course: A live demo.

    Shopify has taken Rails through some of the world's largest sales: Superbowl, Celebrity Launches, and Black Friday. In this talk, we will go through the evolution of the Shopify infrastructure: from re-architecting and caching in 2012, sharding in 2013, and reducing the blast radius of every point of failure in 2014. To 2016, where we accomplished running our 325,000+ stores out of multiple datacenters. It'll be whirlwind tour of the lessons learned scaling one of the world's largest Rails deployments for half a decade.

    Natural Language Processing is an interesting field of computing. The way humans use language is nuanced and deeply context sensitive. For example, the word work can be both a noun and a verb. This talk will give an introduction to the field of NLP using Ruby. There will be demonstrations of how computers fail and succeed at human language. You'll leave the presentation with an understanding of both the challenges and the possibilities of NLP and some tools for getting started with it.

    Mutation testing is a silver bullet for assessing test quality. Mutation testing will help you:

    Write better tests
    Produce more robust code that better handles edge cases
    Reveal what parts of your legacy application are most likely to break before you dive in to make new changes
    Learn about features in Ruby and your dependencies that you didn’t previously know about
    This talk assumes a basic knowledge of Ruby and testing. The examples in this talk will almost certainly teach you something new about Ruby!

    RailsConf 2017: A Clear-Eyed Look at Distributed Teams by Glenn Vanderburg & Maria Gutierrez

    Distributed teams can have big benefits for both employers and employees. But there are many challenges. Being successful requires changes to work practices, communication, and style — and not just from the remote people. Everyone will experience changes. It helps to be prepared … and most of what we see being written and discussed is focused on remote workers, not the organization that supports them.

    In this talk, we will look at the challenges and rewards of working in a distributed team setting based on several years of experience growing large distributed engineering teams.

    Our company is traditional in many ways, one of which being the need to come into the office each day. Our team of software developers bucks that trend, spreading across 6 states and 4 countries. Dev teams consider themselves "Remote First", while DevOps and Application Support are "Local First." Each has adopted tools, habits, and practices to maximize their configuration. Each style has learned valuable lessons from the other. This presentation is about how our teams have evolved: the tools, the compromises, the wins and losses, and how we successfully blend Distributed and Concentrated teams.

    While Rails is the most common Ruby web framework, it’s not the only option. Rack is a simple, elegant HTTP library, ideal for microservices and high performance applications.

    In this talk, you’ll see Rack from top to bottom. Starting from the simplest app, we’ll grow our code into a RESTful HTTP API. We’ll test our code, write reusable middleware, and dig through what Rack provides out of the box. Throughout, we’ll balance when Rack is a good fit, and when larger tools are needed.

    If you’ve heard of Rack but wondered where it fits in the Ruby web stack, here’s your chance!

    People give ruby a bad reputation for speed, efficiency, weak typing, etc. But one of the biggest benefits of an interpreted language is the ability to debug and introspect quickly without compilation. Oftentimes developers reach for heavy-handed libraries to debug their application when they could just as easily get the information they need by using tools they already have.

    In this talk you will learn practical techniques to make debugging easier. You will see how simple techniques from the ruby standard library can greatly increase your ability to keep your codebase clean and bug-free.

    RESTful architecture can narrow the responsibilities of your Rails controllers and make follow-on refactorings more natural. In this talk, you'll learn to refactor code to follow RESTful principles and to identify the positive impact those changes have throughout your application stack.

    How can you confidently ensure that your data is valid without validations?

    In this talk, I’ll introduce some data consistency issues you may see in your app when you begin introducing background jobs and external services. You’ll learn some patterns for handling failure so your data never gets out of sync and we’ll talk about strategies to detect when something is wrong.

What parts of your database should you start thinking about differently? What is "reporting" anyway? Is ActiveRecord enough to pull this off?

    Let's go on a journey through the world of Relational Online Analytical Processing (ROLAP) and see how this can apply to Rails. We'll also look at database considerations and finish with looking at a light DSL that works with ActiveRecord to help make your data dance.

    RailsConf 2017: Portable Sessions with JSON Web Tokens by Lance Ivy

    Ever wonder why applications use sessions and APIs use tokens? Must there really be a difference? JSON Web Tokens are an emerging standard for portable secure messages. We'll talk briefly about how they're built and how they earn your trust, then dig into some practical examples you can take back and apply to your own majestic monolith or serious services.

    RailsConf 2017: Observing Chance: A Gold Master Test in Practice by Jake Worth

    Tests try to observe change. But are some systems too big to observe them all? What if we need to test a function with a very complex output?

    In this talk, we'll explore a Gold Master test– a special test for evaluating complicated legacy systems. We'll look at how this test takes an input, such as a production database, runs it through a transformative function, and then compares the output to an approved version of the output.

    Testers of every experience level will leave this talk with a new technique for evaluating complex environments, and a broader conception of what a test can be.

    You care deeply about code quality and constantly strive to learn more. You devour books and blogs, watch conference talks, and practice code katas.

    That's excellent! But immaculately factored code and clean architecture alone won't guarantee quality software.

    As a developer, your job isn't to write Good Code. It's to deliver value for people. In that light, we'll examine the effects of a host of popular coding practices. What do they accomplish? Where do they fall short?

    We'll set meaningful goals for well-rounded, high-quality software that solves important problems for real people.

    RailsConf 2017: Developer Happiness on the Front End with Elm by Kevin Yank

    Ruby and Rails famously prioritised developer happiness, and took the world by storm. Elm, a new language that compiles to JavaScript, proves that putting developer happiness first can produce very different results on the front end! Born out of Haskell, Elm is as unlike Ruby as programming languages get, but in this session we’ll see how its particular blend of design decisions tackles everything that’s painful about front-end development, making it an excellent choice for the curious Rubyist’s next favorite language.

    Elixir has rapidly developed into a mature language with an ever-growing library of packages that excels at running web apps. And because both Elixir and Phoenix were developed by Ruby / Rails programmers, the ease with which you can learn Elixir as a Ruby developer, is much greater than many other languages. With numerous code examples, this talk will discuss how learning a functional approach to handling web requests can improve what we do every day with Rails. This talk is aimed at people who have some familiarity with Rails but no experience with Elixir is necessary.

    RailsConf 2017: React on Rails by Jo Cranford

    Eighteen months ago, our fairly typical Ruby on Rails app had some mundane client side interactions managed by a tangle of untested JQuery spaghetti.

    Today, new features are built with React, CSS modules, and a far better UX. With ES6 front end code, processed with Babel, compiled (and hot-reloaded in development) with Webpack, and tested with Jest – all within the same Rails application.

    Come along to this talk to hear how we migrated our app a piece at a time to use technologies that don’t always sit naturally alongside Rails. I will cover technical implementations and lessons learned.

    ​Introducing Helix: High-Performance Ruby Made Easy by Godfrey Chan and Yehuda Katz

    This is a sponsored talk by Skylight.

    We got a good productivity boost by writing the original Skylight agent in Ruby, but over time, we couldn't implement all the desired features with its overhead. Ruby is fast enough... until it isn't.

    Introducing Helix — an open-source toolkit for writing native Ruby extensions in Rust, extracted from our Featherweight Agent's DNA. Fast, reliable, productive — pick three. Come join us to find out how you can leverage this power in your Ruby apps and even help make Rails faster!

    (This is not a re-run of Godfrey's talk from last year.)

    Open Sourcing: Real Talk by Andrew Evans

    This is a sponsored talk by Hired.

    Hired open-sources some useful abstractions from our Majestic Monolith® and we've learned a lot. Some tough lessons, and some cool knowledge. We'll cover: When & where should you pull something out of the code? Does it really help? What things are important to think about? What if it never takes off? We'll also look at some design patterns from our open-source work.

    ​Postgres at Any Scale​ by Will Leinweber

    This is a sponsored talk by Citus Data.

    Postgres has powerful datatypes and a general emphasis on correctness which makes it a great choice for apps small and medium. Growing to very large sizes has been challenging—until now!

    First you'll learn how to take advantage of all PG has to offer for small scales, especially when it comes to keeping data consistent. Next you'll learn techniques for keeping apps running well at medium scales. And finally you'll learn how to take advantage of the open-source Citus extension that makes PG a distributed db, when your app joins the big leagues.

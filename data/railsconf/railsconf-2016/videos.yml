    Hiring Developers, with Science! by Joe Mastey

    Nothing makes or breaks our teams like the members they hire. And so we rate and quiz, assign homework and whiteboard algorithms until candidates are blue in the face. But does it work? In this session, we’ll unpack common interviews and how they stack up with research into predicting performance. We’ll learn to design interviews that work, what kinds don’t work at all, and how to tell the difference, with science!

    Your First Legacy Codebase by Coraline Ehmke

    So you've just graduated from a bootcamp and you're starting your first real job in software development. You've got several Rails apps under your belt and you're excited to get started. But few jobs offer the opportunity to build new apps; it's much more likely that you will be part of a team charged with maintaining and growing a legacy application. How can you get started working on an aging codebase when the sum of your experience so far was with greenfield apps?

    Before a request ever hits your Rails application, it winds its way through a series of pieces of Rack middleware. Middleware sets session cookies, writes your logs, and enables the functionality in many gems such as Warden.

    With Rails or any Rack app, you can easily insert your own custom middleware, allowing you to log, track, redirect, and alter the incoming request before it hits your application.

    You will leave this talk confident in writing your own custom middleware, better able to troubleshoot gems that rely on middleware and with an understanding of how your Rails app functions.

    I Can’t Believe It’s Not A Queue: Using Kafka with Rails by Terence Lee

    Your existing message system is great, until it gets overloaded. Then what? That's when you should try Kafka.

    Kafka's designed to be resilient. It takes the stress out of moving from a Rails monolith into a scalable system of microservices. Since you can capture every event that happens in your app, it's great for logging. You can even use Kafka's distributed, ordered log to simulate production load in your staging environment.

    Come and learn about Kafka, where it fits in your Rails app, and how to make it do the things that message queues simply can't.

    Not only may you learn how it works but also, you might learn new tricks from the code itself or discover small features that are not widely publicized.

    You might think that hiring interns is charity work. Your company is bringing on less-than-baked engineers and spending precious engineering resources to train them and bring them up to speed on your technologies.

    Surprise! Interns actually help your team, too. Running a successful internship program helps your team level up its teaching skills, discourages silos, and encourages writing maintainable code. I’ll talk about mistakes, successes, and specific processes to keep your team and interns productive, and you’ll leave this talk with plenty of fodder for hiring interns at your company.

    How We Deploy Shopify by Kat Drobnjakovic

    Shopify is one of the largest Rails apps in the world and yet remains to be massively scalable and reliable. The platform is able to manage large spikes in traffic that accompany events such as new product releases, holiday shopping seasons and flash sales, and has been benchmarked to process over 25,000 requests per second, all while powering more than 243,000 businesses. Even at such a large scale, all our developers still get to push to master and deploy Shopify in 3 minutes. Let's break down everything that can happen when deploying Shopify or any really big Rails app.

In this talk, we'll look at how boot camps prepare their students, how to interview graduates, and how to help them continually learn during their careers, developing a holistic model for hiring and growing boot camp graduates in the process.

    Foreign API Simulation with Sinatra by Konstantin Tennhard

    Nowadays, we often rely on third party services that we integrate into our product, instead of building every aspect of an application. In many cases, well written API clients exist, but on occasion you run into the issue that there isn't a ready to use client or it simply doesn't fit your needs. How do you write a good API client and more importantly how do you test it without hitting the remote API. So far, the standard approach has been replaying requests with VCR or stubbing them with Webmock. There is a third option: simulating foreign APIs with Sinatra from within your test suite!

Along this adventure, we have learned many lessons and gained lots of experience.

    Ever hire someone from a traditional IT organization who seemed like a great person, only to have them end up a sucking pit of negativity that had to be fired? Traditional IT can be an incredibly hostile environment, leading to survival strategies that aren’t always compatible with small agile-based teams. In this session, I will show how these survival strategies came to be, and ways to deprogram them to reduce your recruiting churn. Better yet, the tools to do so are already in agile.

I will explain why it’s important to familiarize yourself with the API you’re consuming prior to coding, as well as share tools to help you get acquainted with an API much faster. Lastly, I will go over debugging and testing the API you’re consuming, because testing is not just for the provider of the API!

Join us as we compare ActiveRecord from Rails with Ecto from Phoenix, a web framework for Elixir. Comparing the same app implemented in both, we'll see why even with two different web frameworks in two different programming languages, it's the differing ORM designs that most affect the result. This tale of compromises and tradeoffs, where no abstraction is perfect, will teach you how to pick the right ORM for your next project, and how to make the best of the one you already use.

    Now our new CI builds Shopify in under 5 minutes, 700 times a day, spinning up 30,000 docker containers in the process. This talk will cover the architectural decisions we made and the hard lessons we learned so you can design a similar build system to solve your own needs.

    Great individuals often outperform their peers, and when going through school and applying for jobs this seems to be the most important aspect. But who is really outperforming whom? Also, what are we using to measure people? How do you know you’re being fair? Hiring is such a subjective topic and of utmost importance when building a team.

    Let’s explore how our strengths and weaknesses affect ourselves and the team and, how we need to look past ourselves when building a team.

    Building Applications Better the First Time by Jessica Roper

    Feature creep is a common problem in many projects. When you have to take into account customer requests and the ideas of designers and developers, how do you finish all of the features on time? Setting expectations and keeping customers happy can be impossible without the right focus, good communications and proper design. This talk will cover tools and tricks that you can use to prioritize what to complete first and help you iterate through the design process more quickly.

    ActionCable for Not-Another-Chat-App-Please by Jesse Wolgamott

    RealTime updates using WebSockets are so-hot-right-now, and Rails 5 introduces ActionCable to let the server talk to the browser. Usually, this is shown as a Chat application -- but very few services actually use chats.

    Instead, Rails Apps want to be able to update pages with new inventory information, additional products, progress bars, and the rare notification. How can we make this happen in the real world? How can we handle this for unauthenticated users? How can we deploy this?

    Ruby 2.3 introduced the precompilation feature which compiles Ruby scripts to a binary data format. You can store them to storage (file systems and so on) and then load from them.

    Many people believe a myth: precompilation is a silver bullet to reduce long boot times. However, our initial evaluations do not show impressive reduction of boot times. We faced the fact that we need more effort to achieve short boot times.

    This talk will introduce this new feature and detailed analysis of Rails application loading time. Also, I will show you our new tricks to reduce loading time.

    This will be a deep look at several of the "minor" features of Rails 5. You won't just learn about the features, but you'll learn about why they were added, the reasoning behind them, and the difficulties of adding them from someone directly involved in many of them.

    Frameworks for Feedback by Rebecca Miller-Webster

    Code reviews, stand ups, retros, and performance reviews acknowledge the importance of communication and feedback, but they don’t help you give negative feedback or ensure that you hear the small things before they become big things.

    Let’s talk about feedback and examine frameworks for how to ask for and frame feedback effectively. Not all situations call for the same type of feedback and some are more sensitive than others. We will look at Non-Violent Communication, techniques from family and marriage therapy, as well as more traditional frameworks for feedback.

    You’re very happy as a Rails developer for drinking the Docker Kool-aid. You just need to toss a Docker image to your Ops team and you're done! However, like all software projects, your Docker containers start to decay. Deployment takes days to occur as you download your gigantic Docker image to production. Everything’s on fire and you can’t launch the rails console inside your Docker container. Isn’t Docker supposed to take all these things away?

    In this talk, I will discuss some Docker optimizations and performance tuning techniques to keep your Rails packaging and shipping pipeline in shape.

I stared at my white board for a few hours and agreed to do it.

    The title of talk, as a result, is necessarily “RSpec and Rails 5”, but don’t let its name lead you to assume the scope of the talk is so narrow. By using the upcoming, perfunctory changes to both libraries as a jumping off point, the discussion quickly broadens to how developers relate to their tools over time, essentially asking “why should RSpec continue existing in 2016?”

    Compose is committed to making remote work work. Our biggest hurdle is communication and teamwork. When we joined forces with IBM, we added a new issue - how to scale. So, our devs built an app we’re open-sourcing called Fizz. Built on Rails, Fizz helps us empower our team to do great work, feel like family, and operate happily and efficiently as an international, remote, self-managing organization. We work transparently, commit to open-source, wear sweatpants, and genuinely enjoy each other and we’re committed to keeping it that way. We harnessed the power of Rails to make that happen.

  description: Aaron was born and raised on the mean streets of Salt Lake City. His
    only hope for survival was to join the local gang of undercover street ballet
    performers known as the Tender Tights. As a Tender Tights member, Aaron learned
    to perfect the technique of self-defense pirouettes so that nobody, not even the
    Parkour Posse could catch him. Between vicious street dance-offs, Aaron taught
    himself to program. He learned to combine the art of street ballet with the craft
    of software engineering. Using these unique skills, he was able to leave his life
    on the streets and become a professional software engineer. He is currently Pirouetting
    through Processes, and Couruing through code for GitHub. Sometimes he thinks back
    fondly on his life in the Tender Tights, but then he remembers that it is better
    to have Tender Loved and Lost than to never have Tender Taught at all.

    Bridging the Gap between Designers and Developers by Ryan R Hughes

    Every project...well most projects...begin in a great kumbaya where everyone is great friends and has high hopes for the future. About halfway through the project, an epic Braveheart style clash begins, with designers firmly lined up on one side and developers on the other.

    In this talk, I'll share some of the things we've discovered over years of working on projects for over 100 clients that have helped to better define requirements and meet the needs of designers and developers throughout the life of a project.

    We will dive deep into visual regression testing, a fast-growing technique for testing apps pixel-by-pixel. We will integrate perceptual diffs in Rails feature specs, and learn how to visually test even complex UI states. We will show tools and techniques for continuous visual integration on every commit, and learn how to introduce team visual reviews right alongside code reviews.

    Your team has been tasked with releasing new and better versions of your product at record speed. But the risk of moving quickly is things break in production and users abandon your buggy app. To stay competitive, you can't just ship fast - you also have to solve for quality.

    We'll rethink what it means to actively monitor your application in production so your team can ship fast with confidence. With the right tooling, workflow, and organizational structures, you don't have to sacrifice release times or stability. When things break, you'll be able to fix errors before they impact your users.

    Although bundle exec rake db:migrate is probably the single biggest killer feature in Rails, there is a lot more to rake.

    Rails offers several rake tasks to help with everyday project management, like redoing a migration because you changed your mind on one of the columns, clearing your log files because they get so big, and listing out the TODOs and FIXMEs.

    What's even more awesome that all that is that you can create your own rake tasks. Got a tedious command-line process? Write a rake task for it!

    Application view layers are always hard to manage. Usually we handwave this as the natural consequence of views being where fuzzy user experience and designer brains meet the cleaner, neater logic of computers and developers. But that handwave can be misleading. View layers are hard to manage because they’re the part of a system where gaps in a team’s interdisciplinary collaboration become glaring. A comprehensive, well-documented styleguide and component library is a utopian ideal. Is it possible to actually get there? It is, and we can do it incrementally with minimal refactor hell.

    Most code is a mess. Most new requirements change existing code. Ergo, much our work involves altering imperfect code.

    That's the bad news.

    The good news is that every big mess consists of many small ones. Certain small problems occur so frequently that they've been given names, and are collectively known as "Code Smells".

    This talk shows how to take a pile of perplexing code, identify the "smells", and surgically apply the curative refactorings. It breaks a messy problem into clear-cut pieces, and proves that you can fix anything without being forced to understand everything.

New client/server architectures create a clear separation of concerns between the server and the client.

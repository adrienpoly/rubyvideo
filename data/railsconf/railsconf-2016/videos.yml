  description: Rails ships as a number of components, Active Record, Active Support,
    ..., largely independent of each other, but somehow something orchestrates them
    and presents a unified view of the system. Then we have config/boot.rb, config/application.rb...
    what do they do? Application initializers, environment configuration, what runs
    when? Understanding how that works becomes an inflection point in any Rails programmer
    that goes through it. You go from that cloudy idea of an initialization that sets
    things up for a certain definition of "things", to a well-understood process.

    a SQL injection attack, we'll cover how to structure your query to keep your data

  description: Ruby is not the fastest language in the world, there is no doubt about
    it. This doesn't turn out to matter all that much – Ruby and its ecosystem has
    so much more to offer, making it a worthwhile tradeoff a lot of the times. However,
    you might occasionally encounter workloads that are simply not suitable for Ruby.
    This is especially true for frameworks like Rails, where the overhead wants to
    be as little as possible. In this talk, we will explore building a native Ruby
    extension with Rust to speed up parts of Rails. What does Rust have to offer here
    over plain-old C? Let's find out!

    Before a request ever hits your Rails application, it winds its way through a series of pieces of Rack middleware. Middleware sets session cookies, writes your logs, and enables the functionality in many gems such as Warden.

    With Rails or any Rack app, you can easily insert your own custom middleware, allowing you to log, track, redirect, and alter the incoming request before it hits your application.

    You will leave this talk confident in writing your own custom middleware, better able to troubleshoot gems that rely on middleware and with an understanding of how your Rails app functions.

    Client/Server Architecture: Past, Present, & Future By Mike Groseclose The client/server architecture that powers much of the web is evolving. Full stack, monolithic, apps are becoming a thing of the past as new requirements have forced us to think differently about how we build apps. New client/server architectures create a clear separation of concerns between the server and the client.

    As developers, we have the ability to create the new abstractions that will power the web. Understanding the past, present, and future of the client/server help us to become more active participants in the future ecosystem for building web applications.

    This talk illustrates the development techniques, Ruby patterns and best practices we adopt at DNSimple to develop new features and ensure long-term maintainability of our codebase. It also features how we used Lotus to develop the new API as a standalone Rack app mounted under the Rails router.

    Two years ago we started a major redesign of our REST API with the goal to decouple it from our main Rails application and expose all the main features via API. It was not a trivial task, but still feasible due to the guidelines we adopted in the last 6 years to structure our Rails application.

    I Can’t Believe It’s Not A Queue: Using Kafka with Rails by Terence Lee

    Your existing message system is great, until it gets overloaded. Then what? That's when you should try Kafka.

    Kafka's designed to be resilient. It takes the stress out of moving from a Rails monolith into a scalable system of microservices. Since you can capture every event that happens in your app, it's great for logging. You can even use Kafka's distributed, ordered log to simulate production load in your staging environment.

    Come and learn about Kafka, where it fits in your Rails app, and how to make it do the things that message queues simply can't.

In this talk you'll see an overview of basic-to-intermediate SQL techniques that you can use to: learn about unfamiliar data sets, identify and resolve slow query problems, quickly build ad-hoc reports, combine multiple tables and perform calculations.

    Specifically targeted to the Junior Rails Developer, we will explore with non-trivial yet approachable examples and see how learning SQL can help you become a better software developer.

I will explain why it’s important to familiarize yourself with the API you’re consuming prior to coding, as well as share tools to help you get acquainted with an API much faster. Lastly, I will go over debugging and testing the API you’re consuming, because testing is not just for the provider of the API!

    ActionCable for Not-Another-Chat-App-Please by Jesse Wolgamott

    RealTime updates using WebSockets are so-hot-right-now, and Rails 5 introduces ActionCable to let the server talk to the browser. Usually, this is shown as a Chat application -- but very few services actually use chats.

    Instead, Rails Apps want to be able to update pages with new inventory information, additional products, progress bars, and the rare notification. How can we make this happen in the real world? How can we handle this for unauthenticated users? How can we deploy this?

    Packaging and Shipping Rails Applications in Docker By Allan Espinosa

    You’re very happy as a Rails developer for drinking the Docker Kool-aid. You just need to toss a Docker image to your Ops team and you're done! However, like all software projects, your Docker containers start to decay. Deployment takes days to occur as you download your gigantic Docker image to production. Everything’s on fire and you can’t launch the rails console inside your Docker container. Isn’t Docker supposed to take all these things away?

    In this talk, I will discuss some Docker optimizations and performance tuning techniques to keep your Rails packaging and shipping pipeline in shape.

    How Compose uses Rails to Scale Work, Now Open-Sourced By JP Phillips

    Compose is committed to making remote work work. Our biggest hurdle is communication and teamwork. When we joined forces with IBM, we added a new issue - how to scale. So, our devs built an app we’re open-sourcing called Fizz. Built on Rails, Fizz helps us empower our team to do great work, feel like family, and operate happily and efficiently as an international, remote, self-managing organization. We work transparently, commit to open-source, wear sweatpants, and genuinely enjoy each other and we’re committed to keeping it that way. We harnessed the power of Rails to make that happen.

    Crushing It With Rake Tasks By Barrett Clark

    Although bundle exec rake db:migrate is probably the single biggest killer feature in Rails, there is a lot more to rake.

    Rails offers several rake tasks to help with everyday project management, like redoing a migration because you changed your mind on one of the columns, clearing your log files because they get so big, and listing out the TODOs and FIXMEs.

    What's even more awesome that all that is that you can create your own rake tasks. Got a tedious command-line process? Write a rake task for it!

    Your Software is Broken — Pay Attention by James Smith

    Your team has been tasked with releasing new and better versions of your product at record speed. But the risk of moving quickly is things break in production and users abandon your buggy app. To stay competitive, you can't just ship fast - you also have to solve for quality.

    We'll rethink what it means to actively monitor your application in production so your team can ship fast with confidence. With the right tooling, workflow, and organizational structures, you don't have to sacrifice release times or stability. When things break, you'll be able to fix errors before they impact your users.

    Great individuals often outperform their peers, and when going through school and applying for jobs this seems to be the most important aspect. But who is really outperforming whom? Also, what are we using to measure people? How do you know you’re being fair? Hiring is such a subjective topic and of utmost importance when building a team.

    Let’s explore how our strengths and weaknesses affect ourselves and the team and, how we need to look past ourselves when building a team.

    Surprise! Interns actually help your team, too. Running a successful internship program helps your team level up its teaching skills, discourages silos, and encourages writing maintainable code. I’ll talk about mistakes, successes, and specific processes to keep your team and interns productive, and you’ll leave this talk with plenty of fodder for hiring interns at your company.

    They bridge your application and your database. They're object-relational mappers, and no two are alike. Join us as we compare ActiveRecord from Rails with Ecto from Phoenix, a web framework for Elixir. Comparing the same app implemented in both, we'll see why even with two different web frameworks in two different programming languages, it's the differing ORM designs that most affect the result. This tale of compromises and tradeoffs, where no abstraction is perfect, will teach you how to pick the right ORM for your next project, and how to make the best of the one you already use.

    Now our new CI builds Shopify in under 5 minutes, 700 times a day, spinning up 30,000 docker containers in the process. This talk will cover the architectural decisions we made and the hard lessons we learned so you can design a similar build system to solve your own needs.

    This will be a deep look at several of the "minor" features of Rails 5. You won't just learn about the features, but you'll learn about why they were added, the reasoning behind them, and the difficulties of adding them from someone directly involved in many of them.

    Secrets of Testing Rails 5 apps by Prathamesh Sonpatki

    Testing Rails 5 apps has become a better experience out of the box. Rails has also become smarter by introducing the test runner. Now we can't complain about not being able to run a single test or not getting coloured output. A lot of effort has gone into making tests -- especially integration tests -- run faster.

    Come and join me as we commence the journey to uncover the secrets of testing Rails 5 apps.

    Bridging the Gap between Designers and Developers by Ryan R Hughes

    Every project...well most projects...begin in a great kumbaya where everyone is great friends and has high hopes for the future. About halfway through the project, an epic Braveheart style clash begins, with designers firmly lined up on one side and developers on the other.

    In this talk, I'll share some of the things we've discovered over years of working on projects for over 100 clients that have helped to better define requirements and meet the needs of designers and developers throughout the life of a project.

    Continuous Visual Integration for Rails by Mike Fotinakis

    Unit testing is mostly a solved problem, but how do you write tests for the visual side of your app—the part that your users actually see and interact with? How do you stop visual bugs from reaching your users?

    We will dive deep into visual regression testing, a fast-growing technique for testing apps pixel-by-pixel. We will integrate perceptual diffs in Rails feature specs, and learn how to visually test even complex UI states. We will show tools and techniques for continuous visual integration on every commit, and learn how to introduce team visual reviews right alongside code reviews.

    Whether you want it or not, you're the constant victim of neuro-marketing. By tapping into your "reptile brain", you are unconsciously made to click, like and buy. We'll look at scarcity, social validation, reciprocity and much more. All web apps have customers of some sort, and it's your job to guide them, either for usability or profit. You'll learn how to see others' influence on you, and maybe to exert some influence of your own.

    Feature creep is a common problem in many projects. When you have to take into account customer requests and the ideas of designers and developers, how do you finish all of the features on time? Setting expectations and keeping customers happy can be impossible without the right focus, good communications and proper design. This talk will cover tools and tricks that you can use to prioritize what to complete first and help you iterate through the design process more quickly.

    Frameworks for Feedback by Rebecca Miller-Webster

    Code reviews, stand ups, retros, and performance reviews acknowledge the importance of communication and feedback, but they don’t help you give negative feedback or ensure that you hear the small things before they become big things.

    Let’s talk about feedback and examine frameworks for how to ask for and frame feedback effectively. Not all situations call for the same type of feedback and some are more sensitive than others. We will look at Non-Violent Communication, techniques from family and marriage therapy, as well as more traditional frameworks for feedback.

    This talk is for anyone who's had to promise new features to a client when they weren't actually sure how they'd deliver on the promise.

    We all have big visions and big ideas, but our teams and abilities are finite resources. We'll talk about how to manage expectations, growth, technical debt and delivery (and still be able to sleep at night despite that last wonky commit). We'll talk about the never-ending product roadmap, product reality and how what we create falls somewhere in between.

    We'll take four journeys from rails new into a reasonable future. The first three, “dedicated team pulling apart the monolith a year later than hoped”, "nothin' beats a monolith", "services from day one" will blow up the Enterprise, while the fourth, “take reasonable steps to let the system evolve”, won't.

    Style Documentation for the Resource-Limited by Betsy Haibel

    Application view layers are always hard to manage. Usually we handwave this as the natural consequence of views being where fuzzy user experience and designer brains meet the cleaner, neater logic of computers and developers. But that handwave can be misleading. View layers are hard to manage because they’re the part of a system where gaps in a team’s interdisciplinary collaboration become glaring. A comprehensive, well-documented styleguide and component library is a utopian ideal. Is it possible to actually get there? It is, and we can do it incrementally with minimal refactor hell.

    Pragmatic Lessons of Rails & Ruby in the Enterprise by Nathan Beyer

    Adopting Rails and Ruby for use within a large development organization was and continues to be an adventure. Rails and Ruby have been in use at Cerner for 7 years and over that time, their use has gone from niche technology used by a handful of people to a core platform used by hundreds. Along this adventure, we have learned many lessons and gained lots of experience. In this talk, we’ll share the interesting up and downs of this adventure in an effort to share our experiences and knowledge.

    Get a Whiff of This by Sandi Metz

    Most code is a mess. Most new requirements change existing code. Ergo, much our work involves altering imperfect code.

    That's the bad news.

    The good news is that every big mess consists of many small ones. Certain small problems occur so frequently that they've been given names, and are collectively known as "Code Smells".

    This talk shows how to take a pile of perplexing code, identify the "smells", and surgically apply the curative refactorings. It breaks a messy problem into clear-cut pieces, and proves that you can fix anything without being forced to understand everything.

    Refactoring sometimes devolves into an appalling mess. You're chasing a broken test suite, and every change just makes it worse. An even more insidious antipattern is the slow, perfectly controlled process culminating in dreadful design.

    This talk presents an end-to-end refactoring that demonstrates simple strategies to avoid such misadventures.

    Foreign API Simulation with Sinatra by Konstantin Tennhard

    Nowadays, we often rely on third party services that we integrate into our product, instead of building every aspect of an application. In many cases, well written API clients exist, but on occasion you run into the issue that there isn't a ready to use client or it simply doesn't fit your needs. How do you write a good API client and more importantly how do you test it without hitting the remote API. So far, the standard approach has been replaying requests with VCR or stubbing them with Webmock. There is a third option: simulating foreign APIs with Sinatra from within your test suite!

    Your First Legacy Codebase by Coraline Ehmke

    So you've just graduated from a bootcamp and you're starting your first real job in software development. You've got several Rails apps under your belt and you're excited to get started. But few jobs offer the opportunity to build new apps; it's much more likely that you will be part of a team charged with maintaining and growing a legacy application. How can you get started working on an aging codebase when the sum of your experience so far was with greenfield apps?

    Storytelling with Code by Michael Rau

    How can you tell a story using only email, a laser printer, voicemail? Last year I created an immersive experience for one audience member in a standard office cubicle. The piece used a rails app and some other custom software and no live actors to tell a story about office culture. This talk focuses on the techniques of digital storytelling, my process of developing the story as I wrote the code, and the strategies I used to create an emotional connection with a user. If you are interested in the intersection between stories, software, game design and narrative design, this talk is for you!

    Tweaking Ruby GC Parameters for Fun, Speed, and Profit by Helio Cola

    Whether you are building a Robot, controlling a Radar, or creating a Web App, the Ruby Garbage Collector (GC) can help you. The stats exposed by the Garbage Collector since Ruby v2.1 caught my attention and pushed me to dig deeper. Both Ruby 2.1 and 2.2 brought great performance improvements. From a practical point of view, we will discuss how to use the GC to enhance the performance of your software, from configuration parameters to different approaches on how you can change them yourself.

    How We Deploy Shopify by Kat Drobnjakovic

    Shopify is one of the largest Rails apps in the world and yet remains to be massively scalable and reliable. The platform is able to manage large spikes in traffic that accompany events such as new product releases, holiday shopping seasons and flash sales, and has been benchmarked to process over 25,000 requests per second, all while powering more than 243,000 businesses. Even at such a large scale, all our developers still get to push to master and deploy Shopify in 3 minutes. Let's break down everything that can happen when deploying Shopify or any really big Rails app.

    Keynote: The Unfortunate Value of Failure By Ramsey Nasser

    Ramsey Nasser is a Lebanese computer scientist, game designer, and educator based in Brooklyn. He researches programming languages by building tools to make computation more expressive and implementing projects that question the basic assumptions we make about code itself. His games playfully push people out of their comfort zones, and are often built using experimental tools of his design. A former Eyebeam fellow and a member of Kitchen Table Coders, when he is not reasoning about abstract unintuitive machines, he builds and maintains vintage motorcycles.

    How I Code and Use a Computer at 1,000 WPM!! By Sina Bahram

    I use a computer very differently than most people, because I'm blind. When I'm surfing the web, tweeting, checking email, reading the news, and writing code, I'm doing so because a program called a screen reader is reading me what's on the screen. I happen to listen to it read me this text at a thousand words per minute! Join me in listening to how I experience some common user interfaces. Yes, I'll slow it down for you. I also have a challenge for everyone in the audience. Can you get through a day only using the keyboard? What about not looking at your screen?

    What is a Bitcoin address? Where do all those weird letters and numbers come from!? Once we figure it out, we can dig deep between the cushions of the cryptocurrency couch and find lost coins claimed by bugs. You might think this would dissuade me from trying to generate addresses and transactions from scratch, but it didn't. Watch in horror as I put my own money at the mercy of my code.

    lol im so random! By Mark Wunsch

    Randomness has many applications in computing ranging from cryptography and statistics to generative art and simulation, but where does randomness come from? When you ask for a random number from your system, how truly random is it? This talk will explore randomness in software practice in a variety of contexts. Touching on sources of entropy, pseudo-random number generation, and what it means to be cryptographically secure, this talk will explore both the algorithms and the APIs that supply us with random numbers. This talk will also cover the mechanisms for testing and verifying statistical randomness. Interspersed seemingly randomly throughout will be some great examples of bots, games, and generative art that use randomness and procedural generation in creative and unusual ways. You will come away from this high-level overview with a newfound sense of respect and awe for the humble Math.random().

    Back in 1971, Cynthia Solomon and Seymour Papert wrote "Twenty things to do with a computer", about their experiences of teaching children to use Logo and their ideas for the future. They were wrong: There's a lot more than twenty. Logo's successor, Scratch, has over thirteen million things that children and adults alike have built. Scratch is radically accessible in a way that puts every other language to shame. This talk is about the history, present, and future of Scratch: why Scratch is about 'coding to learn', and not about 'learning to code'.

    - John Crepezzi
  description:
    I recently started working primarily in a statically-typed functional
    programming language (OCaml). While learning, I spent a lot of time trying to
    fit OCaml into a Ruby-shaped box. While there are plenty of things that I miss
    about Ruby day-to-day, there are also a lot of good lessons to take away! No,
    I’m not talking about static typing, or some rant on how nil is an anti-pattern.
    This talk instead will dig into concepts from around the functional world and
    how they can be modeled in Ruby for cleaner, more future-proof code.

    Dealing with legacy monoliths can be challenging due to accumulated technical debt. When faced with this situation, we usually start looking at different strategies to solve this, like microservices, engines, and modularization, just to name a few.

    When choosing to follow a modular approach, I explored applying microservices patterns to our modular monolith. In this talk, I’ll share my experience in adopting this approach, focusing on ensuring data consistency and distributed transactions, as well as the pitfalls and insights I discovered along the way.

    Database queries through ActiveRecord are an essential part of our application.
    And making these queries performant, dynamic, and readable is hard. \n\nWe can
    solve the above problems. With the right abstractions we can write code that composes
    queries that are performant, dynamic, and readable. Our approach uses a domain
    specific language built on top of ActiveRecord that you can adapt to your own
    application. We do not need a whole new library or framework. We just need query

    Let me show you how I turned my "two left hands" into eight superpower tentacles, going from "I can't draw" to visualizing more and less abstract concepts all over the internet.

    A simple visual framework can let you do the same rather quickly because this is what your brain is wired to do: process and generate images.

    The coding education industry and workplace communication mainly consist of simplified code examples, boring text walls, and sometimes never-ending speeches from the loudest people in meetings.

    All it takes to make abstract concepts visible is identifying your visual thinking type and empowering yourself with a reproducible process to make your communication more understandable, memorable, unique, collaborative, and fun.

    Four years ago, I arbitrarily configured every RuboCop rule and published it as a gem called "standard". 135 releases later, feedback from the community has gradually transformed Standard into a linter & formatter ruleset that most Rubyists can get behind. Today, Standard is delivering on its promise: helping teams stay focused on their work instead of arguing over syntax.

    The time has come to once again configure the unconfigurable by creating a standard-rails based on rubocop-rails. But this time, we'll skip the years of debating rules on GitHub. Instead, we're holding a community straw poll at RailsConf!

    Join us for a town hall-style event where we'll review what each rubocop-rails rule does, hear its pros and cons, and put it to a vote. We'll enshrine the consensus picks in the first public release of standard-rails. By showing up, you'll not only be establishing conventions to promote safe and consistent code, you'll be sharpening the focus of Rails developers around the world!

    Building a more effective, bidirectional mentor-mentee relationship by Andy Andrea, William Frey

    Mentorship is such a key part of our industry that most of us will act as both mentor and mentee many times over the course of our careers. However, unlike our other important skills that get honed through processes like code review or retrospectives, there are often few mechanisms to help us grow as mentors and mentees.

    We’ll cover common problems that occur as both a mentee and mentor and cover strategies, skills and concepts for how to deal with them that originate not only from our own experiences but from research in the fields of education, psychology and business. We’ll cover concepts that won’t only build your skills but improve the value you get from being a mentor or mentee and show you how to make an evidence-backed business case for expanding mentorship at your place of work.

- title: Migrating Shopify’s Core Rails Monolith to Trilogy
  raw_title: RailsConf 2023 - Migrating Shopify’s Core Rails Monolith to Trilogy by Adrianna Chang
  speakers:
    - Adrianna Chang
  description: |-
    Trilogy is a client library for MySQL-compatible databases. It was open sourced along with an Active Record adapter by GitHub this past year. With promises of improved performance, better portability and compatibility, and fewer dependencies, Shopify’s Rails Infrastructure team decided to migrate our core Rails monolith from Mysql2 to Trilogy.

    In this talk, we’ll embark on a journey with database clients, Active Record adapters, and open source contributions. We’ll learn about MySQL protocols, dig into how the Active Record adapter manages the Trilogy client under the hood, and look at some of the missing features we implemented as we moved from Mysql2 to Trilogy. Finally, we’ll discuss the end result of migrating to Trilogy, and the impact it had on Shopify’s monolith in production.

    That was until a magical Capybara entered through his window and asked a question that changed his perceptions forever more:

    "But what about your end to end tests?"

    ...and when he did, everything broke, and he was enlightened.

    - Ali Ibrahim
  description: |-
    No one likes working on Rails upgrades, and who can blame them? They can be thankless, time-consuming, and—worst of all—unpredictable. How long will they take? When can we get back to feature work? What’ll break when they’re deployed? It’s tempting to say, “Let’s do it later,” but later is usually never. Instead of living in fear of the big, scary Rails upgrade, your team can set up systems for incremental change that let you:

    * continue feature work
    * deliver predictable results
    * seamlessly jump into the next upgrade (because there’s always a next upgrade)

    And I’m gonna show you how.

    In the years since I’ve worked on upgrading Rails at GitHub, I’ve refined this approach to Rails upgrades and successfully implemented it at several organizations. In this talk, you’ll learn everything you need to burn down uncertainty and boldly go into your next Rails upgrade.

    In addition to managing backlogs and burndown charts, technology leaders have to follow an ever-changing software landscape, manage team dynamics, and navigate office politics. It’s no surprise that this leads to burnout. This talk will provide tools to help manage stress and reduce burnout.

    Developers are, almost by definition, highly capable and strongly driven individuals. These traits are indispensable to success in creating working code, but they are also the very traits that makes developers susceptible to burn out. People who can get things done often find themselves overwhelmed by their to-do lists.

    This talk will combine the understanding from the trenches of Anjuan Simmons (who has been a developer and engineering manager for more than 20 years) with the academic understanding of his wife, Dr. Aneika Simmons. Together, they will provide a framework for reducing burnout and consistently keeping stress levels in a managed state.

    Taylorism, is a system of management advocated by Fred W. Taylor. The task of management, as he saw it, is to find the best way for the worker to do the job, with proper tools and training, and to provide incentives for good performance.

    There are certain things you’re meant to do in software projects and business. And certain things you’re not. A big rewrite of your app is one of the things you aren’t meant to do.

    Except that’s what we did with a team of 4 engineers, over an 18 month period, successfully migrating 2,500 customer’s data.

    How can we apply the learnings of Taylor, to a massive application rewrite? What did we do and what can you learn when you’re faced with a wild and woolly project? What about our business practises as well as our code helped us make a success of one of software’s shibboleths?

    guidance from a mentor.\" Yeah, it seems clear enough.\n\nMore and more, teams
    rely on mentorship to raise the skills of their under-experienced people. But
    mentorship is not a catch-all solution and has its risks. Without training, poorly
    structured mentorship can hurt the culture and stifle growth more than help. \n\nSo,
    we need a model—a system. A process to lean into that makes it a helpful tool
    and not a blunt hammer. This talk will cover the three stages of integrating a
    mentorship program and how to help a hesitant team."

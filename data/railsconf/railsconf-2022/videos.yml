    with a back of the envelope calculation. But, what else can we use it for, and
    how does it work? Allow me to show you new ways to leverage the console's features
    and become an even more expert debugger. You'll leave with some simple tactics
    to save you time and write more performant code. While you're here, we'll look
    under the hood to see how the features of the console are encoded and we'll trace
    back the history of these libraries to see how they arrived in our Rails application.

    ‘Those who know, do. Those that understand, teach.’

    We might know our way around the classic conventions of our beloved Ruby on Rails, but do we understand them enough to explain those concepts to our peers? In this interactive (participation optional!) game show session, let’s find out!

    After we quickly discuss some of the philosophies of teaching, we’ll divide up into teams and play a Jeopardy! meets Catchphrase hybrid game… with a few surprises along the way! Beginner, intermediate and advanced Rails-devs are welcome, and Portland-themed prizes will be awarded to the winners.

    Marshal is Ruby's ultimate sharp knife, able to transform any object into a binary blob and back. This makes it a natural match for the diverse needs of a cache.

    But Marshal's magic comes with risks. Code changes can break deploys; user input can trigger an RCE.

    We recently decided these risks were not worth it. Breaking with convention, we migrated the cache on our core monolith to MessagePack, a more compact binary serialization format with stricter typing and less magic.

    In this talk, I'll pry Marshal open to show how it works, how we replaced it, and why you might want to do the same.

  description: 'Rails'' Active Record callbacks provide a simple interface for executing
    a process when something happens to a database record. However, sometimes Active
    Record callbacks aren’t the best solution available. For those cases, this talk
    introduces a great alternative: Postgres'' trigger functionality, a way of implementing
    callbacks at the database level. Coupled with Postgres'' listen and notify features,
    you can develop creative solutions for making your Rails app the center of an
    otherwise complex system, managing data syncing and other processes seamlessly,
    regardless of consumers of the app.'

    You want to contribute to an Open Source project, and you have a complex PR to submit. You've tried to keep it small, but sadly getting there took a lot of effort and your branch has more than 30 commits with fixes and reverting of dead ends.

    You know reviewing this will be a nightmare for the project maintainers, and more importantly, it will be almost impossible for anyone in the future to understand what you did by looking at the history.

    In this talk we will look at how Git branches work, and how to manicure them using Rebase to build a commit history your colleagues will love you for.

    In this talk we'll study Active Record associations by writing our own belongs_to
    and has_many macros. We'll dynamically define methods, cache query results, replace
    a a Relation with a CollectionProxy, and automatically prevent N+1 queries with

As our teams and codebase grow and our services need to continue to scale, some of the patterns we use can start to get in our way. We've seen a bit of that at GitHub, and as a result have been experimenting with some new ways to work with ActiveRecord queries, reduce N+1s, and isolate model details.

    On a recent project, I sped up a test suite 15% by making a change to a single factory. This suite, like many others (including yours!), was making way too many database calls. It’s so easy to accidentally add extra queries to factories and test setup and these can compound to shockingly large numbers.

    The chaos is your opportunity! Learn to profile and fix hot spots, build big-picture understanding through diagrams, and write code that is resistant to extraneous queries. This talk will equip you to take back control of your build times and maybe impress your teammates in the process.

    jargon. In this talk, we''ll cover these topics from a Ruby and Rails perspective,
    composing small ideas in everyday language. Before we''re through, you''ll have

    Building realtime applications with Rails has become a no-brainer since Action Cable came around. With Hotwire, we don't even need to leave the comfort zone of HTML and controllers to introduce live updates to a Rails app. Realtime-ification in every house!

    Switching to realtime hides many pitfalls you'd better learn beforehand. How to broadcast personalized data? How not to miss updates during connection losses? Who's online? Does it scale?

    Let me dig into these problems and demonstrate how to resolve them for Action Cable and Hotwire.

    Building a feature is not good enough anymore: all your work won't be of use if it's not performant enough. So how to improve performance? After all, performance is not an easy discipline to master: all slow applications are slow in their own way, meaning that there is no silver bullet for these kinds of problems.

    In this presentation, we will guide you across patterns, strategies, and little tricks to improve performance. We will do that by sharing real stories of our daily experience facing and solving real performance issues in an application that daily serves billions of requests per day.

    Are you considering building a GraphQL API for your Rails project or already have one? Do you know GraphQL can be leveraged beyond HTTP APIs?

    We will explore how GraphQL does not depend on HTTP and can be used as a secure and structured data layer for Rails projects. You will learn to deliver real-time GGraphQL through Websockets, Webhooks containing all the data you need, provide data for WebAssembly code and parallelize queries exporting large amounts of data. Every Rails project needs consistent access to data and GraphQL brings solutions beyond the typical HTTP API.

    One common recommendation for aspiring software developers is to pursue a degree in Computer Science (CS). While CS curricula do often cover practical software development skills, many departments heavily prioritize more academic and theoretical topics. This begs the question: how relevant is a CS degree to the day-to-day work of a professional developer?

    We’ll look at a few topics that are often included in the first half of an undergraduate CS curriculum. We’ll examine this information through two lenses: why it can be helpful and why it might not be all that relevant for a typical Rails dev.

    Further, I will answer the following questions:

    What code greater than 12 years old still runs in Ruby 3.1?
    What idioms have changed?
    And for the brave: how can you set up an environment to run Ruby 1.8 code from ~2008 on a modern machine?

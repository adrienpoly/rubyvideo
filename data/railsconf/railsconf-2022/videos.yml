    Spinning up the rails console can be a quick way to answer a question
    with a back of the envelope calculation. But, what else can we use it for, and
    how does it work? Allow me to show you new ways to leverage the console's features
    and become an even more expert debugger. You'll leave with some simple tactics
    to save you time and write more performant code. While you're here, we'll look
    under the hood to see how the features of the console are encoded and we'll trace
    back the history of these libraries to see how they arrived in our Rails application.

    ‘Those who know, do. Those that understand, teach.’

    We might know our way around the classic conventions of our beloved Ruby on Rails, but do we understand them enough to explain those concepts to our peers? In this interactive (participation optional!) game show session, let’s find out!

    After we quickly discuss some of the philosophies of teaching, we’ll divide up into teams and play a Jeopardy! meets Catchphrase hybrid game… with a few surprises along the way! Beginner, intermediate and advanced Rails-devs are welcome, and Portland-themed prizes will be awarded to the winners.

    Over the course of 14 years, the GitHub.com CSS bundle grew to over 40,000 lines of custom CSS. It became almost impossible to refactor. Visual regressions were common. In this talk, we'll share an honest picture of our successes and failures as we've worked to break up with our CSS bundle by moving towards a component-driven UI architecture.

    Marshal is Ruby's ultimate sharp knife, able to transform any object into a binary blob and back. This makes it a natural match for the diverse needs of a cache.

    But Marshal's magic comes with risks. Code changes can break deploys; user input can trigger an RCE.

    We recently decided these risks were not worth it. Breaking with convention, we migrated the cache on our core monolith to MessagePack, a more compact binary serialization format with stricter typing and less magic.

    In this talk, I'll pry Marshal open to show how it works, how we replaced it, and why you might want to do the same.

    One of the Rails mantras is "convention over configuration," sane defaults
    that limit the cognitive overhead of application development. It's easy to learn
    and easy to build with... right up until you want to deploy your app to production.
    At that point, the hand-holding ends. Like the Roadrunner, Rails stops right before
    the cliff and lets you, Wile E. Coyote, sail over the edge. We have active record
    for interacting with databases, active storage for storing files, etc, but where's
    active deployment? Come learn how Kuby, a new deployment tool, is trying to bridge

    That strange phenomenon where air molecules bounce against each other in a way that somehow comforts you, makes you cry, or makes you dance all night: music. Since the advent of recorded audio, a musician doesn't even need to be present anymore for this to happen (which makes putting "I will always love you" on repeat a little less awkward).

    Sound engineers have found many ways of making music sound good when played from a record. Some of their methods have become industry staples used on every recording released today.

    Let's look at what they do and reproduce some of their methods in Ruby!

    Did you know that people can knock your Rails application offline just
    by submitting specially formatted strings in a form or API request? In this talk,
    we’ll take a look at what’s really going on with a regex denial of service (DoS)
    attack. We’ll take a peek into the CRuby regex engine to see what it’s really
    doing when we ask it to match against a string. With a basic understanding of
    how regular expressions work, we can better understand what these attacks do,
    why they tie up so much CPU, and what we can do to guard against them.

    "Rails' Active Record callbacks provide a simple interface for executing
    a process when something happens to a database record. However, sometimes Active
    Record callbacks aren’t the best solution available. For those cases, this talk
    introduces a great alternative: Postgres' trigger functionality, a way of implementing
    callbacks at the database level. Coupled with Postgres' listen and notify features,
    you can develop creative solutions for making your Rails app the center of an
    otherwise complex system, managing data syncing and other processes seamlessly,
    regardless of consumers of the app."

    You know reviewing this will be a nightmare for the project maintainers, and more importantly, it will be almost impossible for anyone in the future to understand what you did by looking at the history.

    In this talk we will look at how Git branches work, and how to manicure them using Rebase to build a commit history your colleagues will love you for.

    In this talk we'll study Active Record associations by writing our own belongs_to
    and has_many macros. We'll dynamically define methods, cache query results, replace
    a a Relation with a CollectionProxy, and automatically prevent N+1 queries with

    ActiveRecord provides a great deal of flexibility and speed of implementation for developers making new apps. As our teams and codebase grow and our services need to continue to scale, some of the patterns we use can start to get in our way. We've seen a bit of that at GitHub, and as a result have been experimenting with some new ways to work with ActiveRecord queries, reduce N+1s, and isolate model details.

    In this talk, I'll go over some the problems we've been facing, cover how we've been addressing them so far, and show some new experiments & patterns I've been working through.

    What happens under the hood when you run a Ruby script as simple as puts “Hello World!”?

    Time to switch gears from the Rails-level of abstraction to a lower one and dive into some Ruby internals. We’ll be learning about how the Ruby code you write gets compiled and executed, then zoom in to the VM-level – what VMs are and what they do, and how the Ruby VM works. You’ll walk away with a better understanding of how Ruby and Rails works as a whole. No low-level systems knowledge needed!

    What about algebraic data types and parametric polymorphism? If you've been interested
    in these ideas but scared off by the language, you're not alone: for an approach
    that champions composing simple pieces, functional programming is full of complex
    jargon. In this talk, we'll cover these topics from a Ruby and Rails perspective,
    composing small ideas in everyday language. Before we're through, you'll have
    a rich new set of FP ideas to apply to your projects—and you'll finally learn

    Building realtime applications with Rails has become a no-brainer since Action Cable came around. With Hotwire, we don't even need to leave the comfort zone of HTML and controllers to introduce live updates to a Rails app. Realtime-ification in every house!

    Switching to realtime hides many pitfalls you'd better learn beforehand. How to broadcast personalized data? How not to miss updates during connection losses? Who's online? Does it scale?

    Let me dig into these problems and demonstrate how to resolve them for Action Cable and Hotwire.

    uncovered a model that will help managers create an environment where their devs
    can thrive. Our Learn it Do it Teach it (LDT) model will foster more learning,
    while keeping their hands on the code, and adding in the magic touch, teaching.
    This talk will demonstrate how managers can implement a LDT model into a developer’s

    Building a feature is not good enough anymore: all your work won't be of use if it's not performant enough. So how to improve performance? After all, performance is not an easy discipline to master: all slow applications are slow in their own way, meaning that there is no silver bullet for these kinds of problems.

    In this presentation, we will guide you across patterns, strategies, and little tricks to improve performance. We will do that by sharing real stories of our daily experience facing and solving real performance issues in an application that daily serves billions of requests per day.

    Are you considering building a GraphQL API for your Rails project or already have one? Do you know GraphQL can be leveraged beyond HTTP APIs?

    We will explore how GraphQL does not depend on HTTP and can be used as a secure and structured data layer for Rails projects. You will learn to deliver real-time GGraphQL through Websockets, Webhooks containing all the data you need, provide data for WebAssembly code and parallelize queries exporting large amounts of data. Every Rails project needs consistent access to data and GraphQL brings solutions beyond the typical HTTP API.

    One common recommendation for aspiring software developers is to pursue a degree in Computer Science (CS). While CS curricula do often cover practical software development skills, many departments heavily prioritize more academic and theoretical topics. This begs the question: how relevant is a CS degree to the day-to-day work of a professional developer?

    We’ll look at a few topics that are often included in the first half of an undergraduate CS curriculum. We’ll examine this information through two lenses: why it can be helpful and why it might not be all that relevant for a typical Rails dev.

    In 2009 _why tweeted: "programming is rather thankless. you see your works become replaced by superior works in a year. unable to run at all in a few more."
    I take this as a call to action to run old code. In this talk we dig, together, through historical Ruby. We will have fun excavating interesting gems from the past.

    Further, I will answer the following questions:

    What code greater than 12 years old still runs in Ruby 3.1?
    What idioms have changed?
    And for the brave: how can you set up an environment to run Ruby 1.8 code from ~2008 on a modern machine?

    Ever felt overwhelmed when figuring out how to upgrade a Rails app?
    Unsure where you should begin? We’ll talk about how upgrading should be treated
    as a feature, and how you can get buy-in from management for upgrading Rails.
    Have you heard about how GitHub or Shopify uses dual-booting to run two versions
    of Rails at once and wondered how that works? We’ll talk about three approaches
    you can use to upgrade your app. You’ll leave this talk with takeaways you can
    put into practice for your next Rails upgrade.

    How do you build a career you love? As engineers we try to make choices based on data, metrics, research. We make spreadsheets and “Compare Features.” And yet...so often we end up unhappy. All that careful research somehow doesn’t help.

    But what if you made decisions a different way? What if you had a sophisticated decision-making apparatus to guide you, built precisely to your needs -- an always-available guide?

    You do! It’s called your somatic intelligence. With practice you can learn to tune into it and let your body lead the way to satisfaction and fulfillment -- in every area of your life.

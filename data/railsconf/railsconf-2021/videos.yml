#     Code review is ostensibly about ensuring quality code and preventing
#     errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities from making their way to production systems.
#     Code review, as practiced, is often top-down, didactic, and in many cases not
#     particularly useful or effective. By looking at the creative writing workshop
#     model (and strategies for teaching and providing feedback on writing), we can
#     extract patterns that help us to have more effective, more efficient, and more
#     enjoyable code reviews. Not only can we make our code better, we can also help
#     our teams better understand the codebase and communicate better, and thus do more
#     effective and enjoyable work (with perhaps better team cohesion).

#     Let's be blunt: Most web apps aren’t so computation-heavy and won't hit scaling issues.

#     What if yours is the exception? Can Rails handle it?

#     Cue Exhibit A: Cloudinary, which serves billions of image and video requests daily, including on-the-fly edits, QUICKLY, running on Rails since Day 1. Case closed?
#     https://cloudinary.com/

#     Not so fast. Beyond the app itself, we needed creative solutions to ensure that, as traffic rises and falls at the speed of the internet, we handle the load gracefully, and no customer overwhelms the system.

#     The real question isn't whether Rails is up to the challenge, but rather: Are you?

#     When we learn to code, we focus on writing features while we understand what the code is doing. When we debug, we don’t understand what our code is doing. The less we understand, the less likely it is that our usual programming mindset—the one we use for feature development—can solve the problem.

#     It turns out, the skills that make us calmer, more effective debuggers also equip us to deal with rapid, substantial changes to our lives.

#     Whether you’re uncertain about what’s going on in your code, your life, or both, in this talk you’ll learn debugging techniques to get you moving forward safely.

#     As a developer, you're asked to write an awful lot: commit messages, code review, achitecture docs, pull request write-ups, and more. When you write, you have the power to teach and inspire your teammates—the reader—or leave them confused. Like refactoring, it's a skill that can elevate you as a developer but it is often ignored.

#     In this session, we'll use advice from fiction authors, book editors, and technical writers to take a pull request write-up from unhelpful to great. Along the way, you'll learn practical tips to make your code, ideas, and work more clear others.

#     Does a Rails model or config file seem like a magical syntax? Or can you read any Ruby code and understand it as the interpreter does?

#     Ruby's implicitness makes it great for readability and DSLs. But that also gives Ruby a "magical" syntax compared to JavaScript.

#     In this talk, let's convert the implicit to explicit in some familiar Rails code. What was "magic" will become simple, understandable code.

#     After this talk, you'll see Ruby through a new lens, and your Ruby reading comprehension will improve. As a bonus, I'll share a few Pry tips to demystify any Ruby code.

Since then, a discipline has grown around personally meeting the needs of the public, as Library Science has evolved into Information Science. Yet, the goal of assisting with information needs remains the same. There is disciplinary overlap between programming and information science, but there are cultural differences that can be addressed. In other words, applying reference library practices to our teams can foster environments where barriers to asking for and providing help are broken down.

#     Learning to code is an individual journey filled with highs and lows, but for some, the lows seem far more abundant. For some learning to code, and even for some professionals, it feels like we're struggling to tread water while our peers swim laps around us. Some developers take more time to build their technical skills, and that’s ok, as being a great developer is about far more than writing code.

#     This talk looks at realistic strategies for people who feel like they are average-or-below coding skill level, to keep their head above water while still excelling in their career as a developer.

There are many ways to implement it, but our goal was to build it in a way that felt natural in Rails.

#     This talk is for you if you’d like to learn how we used the ActiveModel's API together with the Form Objects pattern to support our dynamic forms feature, and the cherry on top is the usage of Hotwire to accomplish some more advanced features.

#     Everything is cyclical, and web development is not an exception: ten years ago, we enjoyed developing Rails apps using HTML forms, a bit of AJAX, and jQuery—our productivity had no end! As interfaces gradually became more sophisticated, the "classic" approach began to give way to frontend frameworks, pushing Ruby into an API provider's role.

#     Serverless is widely lauded as the ops-free future of deployment. Serverless is widely panned as a gimmick with little utility for the price. Who’s right? And what does it mean for my Rails app?

#     This session takes a critical look at serverless hosting. We’ll consider the abstractions underlying environments such as AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Run, their assumptions and trade-offs, and their implications for Ruby apps and frameworks. You’ll come away better prepared to decide whether or not to adopt serverless deployment, and to understand how your code might need to change to accommodate it.

#     There are a lot of myths around A/B testing. They’re difficult to implement, difficult to keep track of, difficult to remove, and the costs don’t seem to outweigh the benefits unless you’re at a large company. But A/B tests don’t have to be a daunting task. And let’s be honest, how can you say you’ve made positive changes in your app without them?

#     A/B tests are a quick way to gain more user insight. We'll first start with a few easy A/B tests, then create a simple system to organise them. By then end, we'll see how easy it is to convert to a (A/B) Test Driven Development process.

#     You've probably experienced this. CI times slowly creep up over time and now it takes 20, 30, 40 minutes to run your suite. Multi-hour runs are not uncommon.

#     All of a sudden, all you're doing is waiting for CI all day, trying to context switch between different PRs. And then, a flaky test hits, and you start waiting all over again.

#     It doesn't have to be like this. In this talk I'll cover several strategies for improving your CI times by making computers work harder for you, instead of having to painstakingly rewrite your tests.

#     As technologists, we spend a great deal of time trying to become better communicators. One secret to great communication is... to actually say less. And draw more!

#     I've been using sketchnotes, comics, and abstractly-technical doodles for the last few years to teach myself and others about technical concepts. Lo-fi sketches and lightweight storytelling devices can create unlikely audiences for any technical subject matter. I'll break down how my brain translates complex concepts into approachable art, and how anyone can start to do the same, regardless of previous artistic experience.

#     of Ruby on Rails. I'll go over what's changed, what's stayed the same, what worked,
#     and where we went wrong.

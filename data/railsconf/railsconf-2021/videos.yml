    Tech hiring has a bad reputation for a reason - it's usually awful.
    But it doesn't have to be that way. In this talk, we'll dive into what is wrong
    with many current tech hiring practices and what you can do instead. You'll learn
    ways to effectively assess technical ability, what makes a great interview question,
    how to be more inclusive, the pros and cons of giving homework assignments, and
    much more. You'll leave with ideas to improve your interviews, and ways to influence
    your company to change their hiring practices.

    Code review is ostensibly about ensuring quality code and preventing
    errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities from making their way to production systems.
    Code review, as practiced, is often top-down, didactic, and in many cases not
    particularly useful or effective. By looking at the creative writing workshop
    model (and strategies for teaching and providing feedback on writing), we can
    extract patterns that help us to have more effective, more efficient, and more
    enjoyable code reviews. Not only can we make our code better, we can also help
    our teams better understand the codebase and communicate better, and thus do more
    effective and enjoyable work (with perhaps better team cohesion).

    Let's be blunt: Most web apps aren’t so computation-heavy and won't hit scaling issues.

    What if yours is the exception? Can Rails handle it?

    Cue Exhibit A: Cloudinary, which serves billions of image and video requests daily, including on-the-fly edits, QUICKLY, running on Rails since Day 1. Case closed?
    https://cloudinary.com/

    Not so fast. Beyond the app itself, we needed creative solutions to ensure that, as traffic rises and falls at the speed of the internet, we handle the load gracefully, and no customer overwhelms the system.

    The real question isn't whether Rails is up to the challenge, but rather: Are you?

    When we learn to code, we focus on writing features while we understand what the code is doing. When we debug, we don’t understand what our code is doing. The less we understand, the less likely it is that our usual programming mindset—the one we use for feature development—can solve the problem.

    It turns out, the skills that make us calmer, more effective debuggers also equip us to deal with rapid, substantial changes to our lives.

    Whether you’re uncertain about what’s going on in your code, your life, or both, in this talk you’ll learn debugging techniques to get you moving forward safely.

    As a developer, you're asked to write an awful lot: commit messages, code review, achitecture docs, pull request write-ups, and more. When you write, you have the power to teach and inspire your teammates—the reader—or leave them confused. Like refactoring, it's a skill that can elevate you as a developer but it is often ignored.

    In this session, we'll use advice from fiction authors, book editors, and technical writers to take a pull request write-up from unhelpful to great. Along the way, you'll learn practical tips to make your code, ideas, and work more clear others.

    Does a Rails model or config file seem like a magical syntax? Or can you read any Ruby code and understand it as the interpreter does?

    Ruby's implicitness makes it great for readability and DSLs. But that also gives Ruby a "magical" syntax compared to JavaScript.

    In this talk, let's convert the implicit to explicit in some familiar Rails code. What was "magic" will become simple, understandable code.

    After this talk, you'll see Ruby through a new lens, and your Ruby reading comprehension will improve. As a bonus, I'll share a few Pry tips to demystify any Ruby code.

    I saw a green build on a Friday afternoon. I knew I need to push it to production before the weekend. My gut told me it was a trap. I had already stayed late to revert a broken deploy. I knew the risk.

    In the middle of a service extraction project, we decided to migrate from REST to GraphQL and optimize API usage. My deploy was a part of this radical change.

    Why was I deploying so late? How did we measure the migration effects? And why was I testing on production? I'll tell you a tale of small steps, monitoring, and old tricks in a new setting. Hope, despair, and broken production included.

Yet, the goal of assisting with information needs remains the same. There is disciplinary overlap between programming and information science, but there are cultural differences that can be addressed. In other words, applying reference library practices to our teams can foster environments where barriers to asking for and providing help are broken down.

    Advancing through one's career can be challenging. As we experience setbacks, impostor syndrome, and uncertainty at various points of our career, we may develop some habits which, when taken too far, could see us sabotaging our own progress. You are your own worst critic.

    Despite my own experience with anxiety, a bullying internal critic, and “self-deprecating humour”, I'm now a senior engineer and I've noticed these habits in people I mentor. I hope to help you identify signs of these bad habits in yourself and others, and to talk about what has helped me work through it.

    Working with forms is pretty common in web apps, but this time my team was requested to give support for dynamic forms created by admins in an admin panel and used in several places (real story). There are many ways to implement it, but our goal was to build it in a way that felt natural in Rails.

    This talk is for you if you’d like to learn how we used the ActiveModel's API together with the Form Objects pattern to support our dynamic forms feature, and the cherry on top is the usage of Hotwire to accomplish some more advanced features. And all of this is done without a single line of JS :)

    When an open source project has gotten stuck, how do you get it unstuck? Especially if you aren't already its maintainer? My teams have done this with several projects. A new contributor, who's never worked on a project before, can be the catalyst that revives a project or gets a long-delayed release out the door. I'll share a few case studies, principles, & gotchas.

    More than developer time, coordination & leadership are a bottleneck in software sustainability. You'll come away from this talk with steps you can take, in the short and long runs, to address this for projects you care about.

In debugging my own garden, the practice of daily observation has revealed signals previously overlooked. This practice has followed me to the work of tending to our growing application.

    This talk visits some familiar places, code that should work, or seems unnecessarily complicated, and digs deeper to find what we missed at first glance. Let’s explore how we can learn to hear all our application tells us and cultivate a methodical approach to these sticky places.

    That was the start of a journey that took me through a deeper understanding of the Sorbet, Rails and Ruby codebases. The fix is in Ruby 3.0 and I can sleep better now.

    Everything is cyclical, and web development is not an exception: ten years ago, we enjoyed developing Rails apps using HTML forms, a bit of AJAX, and jQuery—our productivity had no end! As interfaces gradually became more sophisticated, the "classic" approach began to give way to frontend frameworks, pushing Ruby into an API provider's role.

    The situation started to change; the "new wave" is coming, and ViewComponent, StimulusReflex, and Hotwire are riding the crest.

    In this talk, I'd like to demonstrate how we can develop modern "frontend" applications in the New Rails Way.

    Serverless is widely lauded as the ops-free future of deployment. Serverless is widely panned as a gimmick with little utility for the price. Who’s right? And what does it mean for my Rails app?

    This session takes a critical look at serverless hosting. We’ll consider the abstractions underlying environments such as AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Run, their assumptions and trade-offs, and their implications for Ruby apps and frameworks. You’ll come away better prepared to decide whether or not to adopt serverless deployment, and to understand how your code might need to change to accommodate it.

    There are a lot of myths around A/B testing. They’re difficult to implement, difficult to keep track of, difficult to remove, and the costs don’t seem to outweigh the benefits unless you’re at a large company. But A/B tests don’t have to be a daunting task. And let’s be honest, how can you say you’ve made positive changes in your app without them?

    A/B tests are a quick way to gain more user insight. We'll first start with a few easy A/B tests, then create a simple system to organise them. By then end, we'll see how easy it is to convert to a (A/B) Test Driven Development process.

    All of a sudden, all you're doing is waiting for CI all day, trying to context switch between different PRs. And then, a flaky test hits, and you start waiting all over again.

    It doesn't have to be like this. In this talk I'll cover several strategies for improving your CI times by making computers work harder for you, instead of having to painstakingly rewrite your tests.

    As technologists, we spend a great deal of time trying to become better communicators. One secret to great communication is... to actually say less. And draw more!

    I've been using sketchnotes, comics, and abstractly-technical doodles for the last few years to teach myself and others about technical concepts. Lo-fi sketches and lightweight storytelling devices can create unlikely audiences for any technical subject matter. I'll break down how my brain translates complex concepts into approachable art, and how anyone can start to do the same, regardless of previous artistic experience.

    ow we communicate words is important, the code, test and documentation needs to be part of the ongoing process to treat better our coworkers, be clear on what we do without the need of established words as "blacklist". Do you mean restricted? rejected? undesirable? think again.

    Master, slave, fat, archaic, blacklist are just a sample of actions you may not be aware of hard are for underrepresented groups. We, your coworkers can't take it anymore because all the suffering it create on us, making us unproductive, feeling second class employee or simply sad.

    Let's make our code, a better code.

    More of us are building apps to make sense of massive amounts of data.
    From public datasets like lobbying records and insurance data, to shared resources
    like Wikipedia, to private data from IoT, there is no shortage of large datasets.
    This talk covers strategies for ingesting, transforming, and storing large amounts
    of data, starting with familiar tools and frameworks like ActiveRecord, Sidekiq,
    and Postgres. By turning a massive data job into successively smaller ones, you
    can turn a data firehose into something manageable.

    The written word is the medium through which most information exchanges
    hands in the tools we build. Digital letterforms can help or hinder the ability
    for people to communicate and understand. We'll work through some typographic
    principles and then apply them to the web with HTML and CSS for implementation.
    We'll look at some of the newer OpenType features and touch on the future of digital
    type, variable fonts, and more.

    The first commit for the DNSimple application was performed in April
    2010, when Ruby on Rails was on version 2.3. Today DNSimple still runs Ruby on
    Rails, version 6.0. The journey from of the DNSimple application to today's version
    is a study in iterative development. In this talk I will walk through the evolution
    of the DNSimple application as it has progressed in step with the development
    of Ruby on Rails. I'll go over what's changed, what's stayed the same, what worked,
    and where we went wrong.

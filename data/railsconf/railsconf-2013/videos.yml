  description: "Elasticsearch is a powerful text search engine that's easy to configure
    and to integrate into your Rails and Ruby applications. But it's more than just
    a general text search engine--elasticsearch stores data in JSON format allowing
    for faceting and complex searches. There are gems that integrate it with ActiveRecord,
    but it can also be used easily outside of ActiveRecord. Learn from the real-world
    application of elasticsearch for general text searches to specific catalog-type
    searches. \n\nWe'll cover the elasticsearch basics, the existing gems you can
    use to integrate, and the lessons learned from integrating into existing projects.
    Examples include: how to index existing ActiveRecord models for general text searches,
    how to use elasticsearch for autocomplete, and how to use for complex queries.\n\nHelp

    Out of the box, Rails provides facilities for preventing attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and more. As a result, it's considered one of the most secure web application frameworks available.
    Digging deeper, however, you can find a number of places where Rails' default behavior is not as secure as it could be. This talk will focus on longstanding, known weak spots that create risks for your application and business if you are not aware of them.

    The last few months have been pretty brutal for anyone who depends on Ruby libraries in production. Ruby is really popular now, and that's exciting! But it also means that we are now square in the crosshairs of security researchers, whether whitehat, blackhat, or some other hat. Only the Ruby and Rails core teams have meaningful experience with vulnerabilites so far. It won't last. Vulnerabilities are everywhere, and handling security issues responsibly is critical if we want Ruby (and Rubyists) to stay in high demand.
    Using Bundler's first CVE as a case study, I'll discuss responsible disclosure, as well as repsonsible ownership of your own code. How do you know if a bug is a security issue, and how do you report it without tipping off someone malicious? As a Rubyist, you probably have at least one library of your own. How do you handle security issues, and fix them without compromising apps running on the old code? Don't let your site get hacked, or worse yet, let your project allow someone else's site to get hacked! Learn from the hard-won wisdom of the security community so that we won't repeat the mistakes of others.

    Why do we all know a developer who has been pounding out unmaintainable code for a decade or more? Why do people "believe in TDD but I don't have time to write tests during crunch?" How is it that we have an entire industry based around rescuing teams from acutely awful Rails apps?
    It's because on the job experience is a poor teacher; plateauing as soon as the developer is able to ship code that meets requirements. Schools teach Computer Science which is only tangentially related to being a developer and most kata's are approached incorrectly, giving no value at best, and reinforcing poor practices at worst. On top of all this, our pairs (for the lucky ones who pair program) probably have not shown us anything new in months.
    This presentation will give specific, concrete steps on how to slowly and steadily improve our game through practice and hard work. I'll identify what skill Rails developers should be focusing on and walk the audience through how to target and eliminate these weaknesses so that nothing but white hot joy streams out of our fingers and into our apps. There's no magic here, no secrets, and no hacks; just you and me working our butts off until we suck a little less.

    Tobias Lutke wrote the first line of code for Shopify nearly 10 years ago to power his own Snowboard shop. Two years later Shopify launched to the public on a single webserver using Rails 0.13.1. Today Shopify powers over 40k online stores and processes up to half a million product sales per day across the platform. Over 30 people actively work on Shopify which makes it the longest developed and likely largest Rails code base out there.
    This is the story of how Shopify has evolved to handle its immense growth over the years. This is what getting big is all about: evolving to meet the needs of your customers. You don't start out with a system and infrastructure that can handle a billion dollar in GMV. You evolve to it. You evolve by adding caching layers, hardware, queuing systems and splitting your application to services.
    This is the story of how we have tackled the various scaling pain points that Shopify has hit and what we have done to surpass them, what we are doing to go even further.

    We'll describe specific techniques used in TDD which touch on: Integration testing with RSpec+Capybara, Model Associations and Data Validations, Asynchronous Jobs, Emails, 3rd Party Services, and JSON API endpoints.

    APIs are interfaces, just like UIs. But while a website or a mobile app is designed to be used by a consumer, an API has two very specific audiences in mind: other systems, and the programmers who build them.
    A well-designed API can make or break an application. So how do developers build great APIs? What design principles should be followed? We will discuss these questions based on the work of thinkers in the areas of industrial design, writing, and product design theory.

    Self-documenting code is a pipe dream. TDD (or BDD) is not the panacea of testing. In the pursuit of test coverage we've forgotten what really matters: getting things done. Lets talk about putting documentation and testing into their proper place. Tools that ease maintenance, help other developers join a project, and reduce bugs.
    I'm going to go over lessons learned in writing, maintaining, and introducing new developers to 20,000 lines of code. Specifically, how we are testing, documenting, and refactoring our code to stay sane, make the team happier, and get more done.

  description: "Go has rapidly built a reputation as a great language for web development.
    But as Rails developers, we already have a really, really great language for web
    development -- why should we be interested in Go?\nI'm convinced that every web
    developer would benefit from exposure to the Go approach to programming, which
    places a strong emphasis on up-front error handling and modular, namespaced libraries.
    Let's sit down and compare some code!\nIn this talk, we will: \n* Compare idiomatic
    approaches to common problems such as error handling, dependency management and
    testing in Go and Ruby. \n* Think carefully about tradeoffs between different
    programming styles and examine how programming languages encourage one style or
    another. \n* Tease out common ideas and best practices that apply to all web applications,
    regardless of language or framework. \n* Read a bunch of code.\nWe will not: \n*
    Try to convince anyone to ditch Ruby/Rails and embrace Go. \n* Make vague, unsubstantiated
    claims about the benefits of static or dynamic typing. \n* Assume any prior knowledge
    of Go."

    In this session we'll go off the Rails and take a look at what our Pythonista cousins are doing with Django.
    I'll start with some live coding: recreating DHH's infamous 15 minute blog demo using Django and explaining the building blocks of a Django app along the way. I'll then take that app and use it to look at some design decisions Django makes, and how they compare to Rails. You'll see convention over configuration in places you didn't expect it, why Django doesn't need attr_accessible or strong parameters, and how the template method pattern could change your life.
    Why talk about Python at a Rails conference? Seeing another way of doing things forces us to think about what we're doing, challenges or validates the assumptions we make about our work, and inspires us to try new things.

    Snappiness is an important key for any successful webpage. Most companies try to achieve responsive webshops by scaling their hardware big time. But Rails in combination with Nginx, Memcached and Redis is the key to deliver webpages very fast with a minimal amount of hardware. This talk will start with the basics of DHH's russian doll idea but will raise the bar than quite a bit. How can we combine fragment caching, page caching and HTTP caching to deliver personalized webshop pages for logged in users? How much brain can be delegated to Redis or the Webbrowser? Harddrive space is cheap. So use it! You'll get to know how to plan your data structure and where to use Memcached vs. Redis. Include the cache in the beginning of your development and not in the end. To make things a bit more interesting everything is replayed on a Raspberry Pi to show how much difference intelligent caching can make on any hardware. Save big time and get more clients with a faster web application!

    Using some real-life examples, I'll explain how to use Pry effectively.
    We'll start from the beginning, with simple features for exploring libraries and source-code in glorious technicolor. Then we'll move up a level and discuss how to inspect, debug and even modify a program while it is still running.

    What is the best data storage option for your application? We have an abundance of conventional wisdom when it comes to building applications on top of a relational database in the Ruby world. Building an application on top of a NoSQL database is a different story. I will present a conceptual framework for understanding Access Patterns that jives with properties of databases, then review common NoSQL databases and propose considerations for choosing one over another. I will also review some uncommon NoSQL databases that address common use cases, and suggest that perhaps some of these should be used more often. Most importantly, I will describe the different state of mind that you should have when building applications on top of these NoSQL options, and provide visualization of non-relational concerns like: fault tolerance, availability, consistency, capacity planning, and horizontal vs vertical scaling. Whether or not you choose a NoSQL option for a future project, you won't look at data storage options in the same way after this presentation. ;-)

    Let's be honest: ActiveRecord's got issues, and it's not going to deal with them on its own. It needs our help.
    Don't think so? Let's take a closer look together. We'll examine the myriad of perils and pitfalls that await newbie and veteran alike, ranging from intentionally inconsistent behavior to subtle oddities arising from implementation details.
    Of course, as with any intervention, we're only doing this because we care. At the very least, you'll learn something you didn't know about ActiveRecord, that helps you avoid these gotchas in your applications. But I hope that you'll leave inspired to contribute to ActiveRecord, engage in discussion about its direction with the core team, and therefore improve the lives of your fellow Rails developers.
    WARNING: We will be reading the ActiveRecord code in this talk. Not for the faint of heart.

    Most of us know how to build beautiful web applications with Rails. With the help of templating tools like ERB and HAML our web apps create HTML documents, but, do you know exactly how those HTML documents end up in a browser?
    During this talk I will show you the bits that make it all happen. We will dissect the relevant code within Rails, Rack and the thin web server to discover exactly how the web server starts and listens to a TCP port, communicates with Rails and returns the HTML document that your browser parses.
    Why? Because we're curious about it, that's why.

    Ever wondered what Rails is doing behind the scenes? What happens to an HTTP request after it leaves your browser? How does Rails process the response?
    In this beginner talk, Aimee Simone and Christopher Green break down the request/response cycle of a web application, navigating through the magestic internals of Rails. We'll outline the responsibilities of each Rails component, including its MVC framework and RESTful routing concepts. By following the flow from a client HTTP request to a completed server response, you'll gain a better understanding of the anatomy of a Rails application.

    Paul Graham once quipped that "Web 2.0" really meant "JavaScript now works". Nearly ten years later, more and more functionality of our web applications is written in JavaScript. But for those of us who came of age when JavaScript was unreliable, it's been preferable to test the server-side, while leaving the UI a thin-as-possible shell. Testing the front-end was error prone and brittle.
    However, when you're delivering a JavaScript widget hundreds of thousands of times a day on diverse third party websites, it needs to work. So: we need to test it, and those tests need to be as painless as possible to write and maintain.
    This is a session for front-end testing skeptics (like me): It is possible to create tests that drive your web UI (JavaScript and all) that are automated, fast, reliable, headless -- no browser required -- and written in pure Ruby instead of some obtuse syntax. We'll explore the challenges and gotchas of testing the front-end and walk through an example that meets the above goals.

    Good integration tests are hard. There are many approaches for testing server/client HTTP libraries - all with various tradeoffs and problems that come up. Some are obvious, some are a little more tricky.
    I'll run through some approaches and problems I've come across developing server/client APIs, while developing these in a highly distributed systems setup at Engine Yard.

    on an active master branch  By: Andrew Bloomgarden and Julian Giuca

    Long-running branches are painful, but upgrading to Rails 3 requires one if you can't stop development, right? Wrong! At New Relic, we worked on upgrading to Rails 3 on master while letting development continue in Rails 2. We patched Bundler, built a backwards-compatible boot sequence, and punched ActiveScaffold in the face. Other developers, meanwhile, released 1400 commits worth of work without noticing any changes. We'll talk about what we did, why we did it, and why we think this approach can help developers get over the hurdle into the Rails 3 promised land.

    You understand Ruby and Rails, and you've gotten the hang of using other peoples' gems - but what about writing your own? Gems underpin almost every piece of Ruby code we write - and so, being able to craft your own gems is not only incredibly useful, it provides an avenue for code reuse and open source sharing. During this session, Pat will first discuss the ecosystem around gems and the knowledge required to write your own, plus a few tools available to assist with this, and some approaches for how to structure gems that integrate with Rails itself. The workshop will then put this knowledge into practice by building our own gems from scratch.

    Building a web app consists of stressful choices. Should the signup button be red or blue? Does my site's sales pitch sound awkward? What will the user think about my site the first five seconds they visit?
    Using Rails and Amazon's Mechanical Turk service, I will show you how you can perform usability tests, A/B testing and gain valuable feedback on your site BEFORE launching your app to a single real user.
    I'll walk you through :
    1) Sample code for quickly integrating your Rails site with Mechanical Turk
    2) How to structure your HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) so that you solicit detailed feedback from the workers.
    3) Integrating A/B testing so that you can quickly decide which design component is better
    4) Tactics for stopping automated bots from ruining your usability tests

    By Chris Kelly

    The dreams of developers working on monolithic Rails applications are frequently filled with sugar plums and service-oriented architectures--but like any kind of software design, SOA can easily become a tangled mess. Many of the same principles that guide our software design can guide our architecture design. We apply SOLID principles to applications to keep them loosely coupled, we design interfaces so we can send logical messages to our domain objects. We hide our databases behind abstractions because how we access our data shouldn't matter to how we consume it. Rarely, though, do we see the same practices applied to our services and APIs, leaving us with tightly coupled and difficult to extend service-oriented architectures. If you are facing the monorail to SOA challenge, consider looking at your services as objects and your APIs as messages. Service-oriented applications are complex, and the best way to fend off complexity is though object-oriented design.

    We hear the stories every so often. A study concludes that internet usage is making us "dumber", while another connects online activity to anxiety or depression. A respected journalist questions whether our advanced technology is really improving our lives. A mass movement of people deleting their Facebook or Twitter accounts sweeps through the community.
    As developers, we hear these stories, and we shrug. Luddites and fearmongers, we call them. But don't they have a point? Do we truly understand what technology is, and how it impacts our society, the way we think and what we value? An important conversation is taking place. As Rails developers, as professionals working on the cutting edge of consumer technology, we should be involved.
    This talk is a brief introduction to the philosophy of technology. We'll examine a few of the major views-- the writings of the philosophers, academics, and engineers who are asking questions regarding technology and society. We'll also explore what these questions mean for us as developers, what they can tell us about our profession, and what we can uniquely contribute to the conversation. We may not find a lot of solid answers, but we'll plow a rich field for discussion, and maybe gain a new perspective into just what it is that we spend our time doing.

    As Ruby Developer I've had a pretty involved relationship with my Mac. I own iPads and iPhones since Apple started to make them. A few years back I told myself I was going to build apps for the Mac/iPhone/iPad but then reality sunk in when I started learning Objective-C and using XCode. The environment (and the language) felt like a trip back to 1995.
    If you are a Web developer used to working with dynamically-typed, lightweight languages, following agile practices like Test-Driven Development, and comfortable with a Unix Shell, then jumping into a development world with an ugly cousin of C++ and an IDE that looks like an F16 cockpit just doesn't seem appealing.
    Luckily for us there is an alternative in RubyMotion, a Ruby-based toolchain for iOS that brings a Ruby on Rails style of development to the world of iOS application development.
    In this talk I will show you how you can use well engrained Ruby practices like TDD to build iOS Apps with RubyMotion.

    Do you have to look at Rails models with 2500 lines of code? Or 200 line methods loaded with iterators, conditionals and instance variables? Not only you, even the code author does not understand what's going on in there.
    I'll show you how you can craft simple and beautiful Rails application by adopting functional programming inspired ideas. Say goodbye to the mess you have by constructing tiny classes and functions that you can use to build up a complex system.

    Starting Rails applications is one thing, but how you apply the priciples of MVC as an application grows determine whether your application is modular and maintainable or a convoluted mess. In this session, we'll use an existing application to explore and practice some of the common mistakes, correct techniques, and concepts behind the techniques to improve your development patterns.

  description: "As your simple Rails app grows into a larger system or set of systems,
    using simple constants and Yaml files for configuration may no longer suffice.
    The meaning of 'configuration' expands to include business logic alongside the
    customary hostnames and timeout intervals; the rate at which configuration changes
    are required increases; non-engineers begin to require the ability to make configuration
    changes themselves; different environments require different configurations. This
    presentation will examine several patterns that can be applied to handle these
    issues, keeping iteration team high and reducing the burden on your engineering
    team. We'll create and iterate on a simple game as a case study to illustrate
    the value of these principles in practice, and also look at a few open source
    projects that integrate some of these concepts.\nTopics: \n* moving configuration
    values out of source \n* sharing configuration across multiple applications/services
    \n* working with sensitive configuration data (eg API keys) \n* dynamically updating
    configuration without deployments or restarts \n* cascading/overlaying configuration

    When you're building a payment platform, you want to make sure that your system is always available to accept orders. However, the complexity of the platform introduces the potential for it to go down when any one of the moving parts fails. In this talk, I will show you the approaches that we've taken and the risks that we have to take to ensure that our platform will always be available for our customers. Even if you're not building a payment platform, these approaches can be applied to ensure a high availability for your platform or service as well.

    Building services and integrating them into Rails is hard. We want smaller Rails apps and nicely encapsulated services, but services introduce complexity. If you go overboard in the beginning, you're doing extra work and getting some of it wrong. If you wait too long, you've got a mess.
    At Yammer, we constantly clean up the mess that worked well in the early days, but has become troublesome to maintain and scale. We pull things out of the core Rails app, stand them up on their own, and make sure they work well and are fast. With 20+ services, we've learned some lessons along the way. Services that seem clean in the beginning can turn into development environment nightmares. Temporary double-dispatching solutions turn into developer confusion. Monitoring one app turns into monitoring a suite of apps and handling failure between them.
    This talk looks at our mistakes and solutions, the tradeoffs, and how we're able to keep moving quickly. Having services and a smaller Rails codebase makes for scalable development teams, happier engineers, and predictable production environments. Getting there is full of hard decisions -- sometimes we get it right, sometimes we get it wrong, but we usually have a story to tell.

    So you've just added a suite of RESTful APIs to your web service. Now you need to generate documentation and build Ruby, Python, and JavaScript clients to consume those new APIs. With so many moving parts, how do you keep your service, documentation and clients in sync?
    We all know how to describe data using ActiveRecord models. Have you considered using a model to describe your service?
    A service model provides a number of benefits including: easy to generate API documentation, consistent server side parameter validation, versioned APIs, easy to build clients, and more. It also represents a unified view of your API which helps to keep your code and documentation DRY. But what does a service model look like? For instance, did you know that your APIs can be described using just four parameter types? What if your could express your APIs using a Rails DSL?
    This talk will introduce Seahorse, a DSL for describing API operations for just about any web service. It provides all of the above functionality, allowing you to describe your service model in a single place with Ruby code. We will demonstrate how to use Seahorse to generate clients, model existing real-world APIs, and even build one of our own

    It's always inspiring to me to hear about how the technology stack I'm familiar with has been used to solve interesting problems; this is one of the extreme versions of that experience. Over the last few years, Rails has been used to solve several of the logistical pain points of the third largest fire service organization in the state of Missouri, and in this talk we're going to look at how it happened. Along the way we'll look at some of the challenges of working with such an out-of-the-ordinary organization and how Rails fit into addressing some fairly unique requirements and constraints. This is one Rails-in-the-wild case study that you won't want to pass up.

    With Rails 4.0 killing off the humble plugin, there is never a better time to learn how to create reusable code using Engines. Creating an engine can be as simple as adding a model, or a complex as an entire content management system. Using the Asset Pipeline, even javascript and css files can be packaged and shared, making projects cleaner and more maintainable than ever before.
    This talk will cover how developers can create their own engines, to add new controllers/models/views, rake tasks and/or generators. It will cover how engines can interact with Rails having their own initializers and middleware. Finally, based on our experiences converting BrowserCMS and its entire module ecosystem to work as mountable engines, this talk will cover how to make engines that are designed to work together, extend each other engine's behavior and make it easy for developers to upgrade when you release new versions.

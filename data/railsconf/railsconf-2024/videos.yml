    When you write tests, you are interacting with your code. Like any user experience, you may encounter friction. Stubbing endless methods to get to green. Fixing unrelated spec files after a minor change. Rather than push on, let this tedium guide you toward better software design.

    With examples in RSpec, this talk will take you step-by-step from a troublesome test to an informed refactor. Join me in learning how to attune to the right signals and manage complexity familiar to any Rails developer. You’ll leave with newfound inspiration to write clear, maintainable tests in peace. Your future self will thank you!

    Logging is often an afterthought when we put our apps in production. It's there, it's configured by default and it's... good enough?

    If you have ever tried to debug a production issue by digging in your application logs, you know that it is a challenge to find the information you need in the gigabyte-sized haystack that is the default rails log output.

    In this talk, let's explore how we can use structured logging to turn our logs into data and use dedicated tools to ask — and answer — some non-obvious questions of our logs.

    Ruby on Fails - effective error handling with Rails conventions by Talysson Oliveira Cassiano

    You ask 10 different developers how they handle errors in their applications, you get 10 very different answers or more, that’s wild. From never raising errors to using custom errors, rescue_from, result objects, monads, we see all sorts of opinions out there. Is it possible that all of them are right? Maybe none of them? Do they take advantage of Rails conventions? In this talk, I will show you error-handling approaches based on patterns we see on typical everyday Rails applications, what their tradeoffs are, and which of them are safe defaults to use as a primary choice when defining the architecture of your application

    Applications exist in changing ecosystems, but over time, they can become less responsive. Controllers actions slowly grow in responsibilities. Models designed for one requirement, no longer fit the bill, and require multi-step deploy processes to change.

    The plain old Ruby object, the mighty PORO, provides flexibility in both new domain and legacy code.

    Pair with me on how! We'll explore how we can leverage POROs in our application through some real world examples. We'll use objects as a facade for domain logic in development, and refactor objects out of legacy code to increase readability, ease of testing, and flexibility. You'll leave this session with some strategies to better leverage Ruby objects in your own application.

But Ruby is a dynamic language and Rails makes extensive use of its meta-programming features. Can we get information from the runtime instead and use that to increase developer happiness?

Join us for an in-depth exploration of Ruby LSP Rails, and learn how to extend it to support the Rails features most important to your app.

    When you riff, you work with Ruby code in a scratch file to help drive your design. This way you get rapid feedback and can revise as quickly as you had the idea — try out alternative implementations too! It's great for building shared understanding by pairing with a coworker.

As the new businesses switched to prioritizing productivity and pragmatism again, Rails 7 had stepped up its game with Hotwire. But is the startup community ready to renew the vows with Rails and commit to each other again? The answer is: Maybe!

Discover how the roles and skills in D&D can enlighten the way we build, manage, and nurture diverse engineering teams. Whether you’re a manager aiming to construct a formidable team (Constitution) or an individual seeking to self-assess and advance your career (Charisma), this talk will guide you in leveraging technical and transferable talents. Together we’ll identify your developer archetype and complete a 'Developer Character Sheet'—our tool for highlighting abilities, proficiencies, and alignment in a fun, D&D-inspired format. Developers and managers alike will leave this talk with a newfound appreciation for the varied skills and talents each person brings to the table.

    I built a Rails-based game with a partner...an AI partner!

    Come see how I worked with my associate, Atheniel-née-ChatGPT, and everything we achieved.

    Leave with an improved understanding of how to talk to that special machine in your life ❤️❤️❤️ and an increased sense of wonder at how magical an extended machine-human conversation can be.

    I'll be taking you through our entire shared experience, from discovering and iterating on our initial goals, to coming up with a project plan, to developing a working product.

    This is not "AI wrote a game" -- this is "Learn how to pair with an artificial intelligence as if they were a human partner, and push the boundaries of possibility!"

This talk will dive into building an offline-first RSS feed reader that leverages the full potential of PWAs such as Service Workers, Background Sync,

    We'll explore how to register, install, and activate a service worker in a Rails application.

    We'll delve into the Push API integrated with service workers, discussing how to subscribe users to notifications.

    We'll cover setting up background sync in our service worker, creating a system that automatically updates the cached RSS feeds and articles.

    The talk will not only solidify the concepts discussed but also provide attendees with a clear roadmap to developing their PWAs.

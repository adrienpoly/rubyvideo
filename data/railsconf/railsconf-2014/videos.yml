    Let's take some tangled code and untangle it together! We'll improve some model, controller and view code by applying view concerns, helpers, Draper decorators, presenters, and service objects. In doing so, you'll better understand where and when to use these techniques to make your code DRY'er, simpler, and easier to test. As a bonus, you'll also see how RubyMine with VIM bindings boosts refactoring productivity.

    Justin, aka @railsonmaui, is freelance Rails programmer and the technical evangelist for RubyMine. Passionately writing software since 1985, and focusing on Rails since 2011, he has a popular technical blog at http://www.railsonmaui.com. Degrees include a BA, Harvard and a MBA, UC Berkeley.

    To get a grip on what "data science" really is, we'll work through a real text mining problem live on stage. Our mission? Trace the evolution of popular words and phrases in RailsConf talk abstracts over the years! We'll cover all aspects of the problem, from gathering and cleaning our data, to performing analysis and creating a compelling visualization of our results. People often overlook Ruby as a choice for scientific computing, but the Rails ecosystem is surprisingly suited to the problem.

    Originally a "math guy", Todd spent six years working for a hedge fund building models to value mortgage-backed securities before a fortuitous foray into web programming got him tangled up with Rap Genius. His recent Rails work includes Rap Stats, Wedding Crunchers, and Gambletron 2000.

    Tests are a good tool to verify your code but how do you verify your tests? Mutation testing is a technique to evaluate the quality of your tests by programmatically mutating (i.e. making a series of small modifications to) your code and ensuring that the tests no longer pass. This talk will attempt to demonstrate the value of mutation testing and show you how to use Mutant to improve the quality of your tests and your code.

    We're comfortable with HTTP, but using it for communication in your SOA isn't simple. You need load balancers, URL discovery, SSL, and there's a cost to set up and tear down that HTTP window.

    Rack-AMQP lets you serve your rack (and rails) apps over AMQP, a robust, open protocol for messaging. You get simple queues, load balancing, security, and persistent connections for free (plus pub-sub!)â€”without changing your app.

    Learn the pitfalls of HTTP and why you should use AMQP in your SOA!

    Josh is the host of the Ruby Hangout, an online Ruby meetup. Josh also coorganizes DCRUG and is the CTO at Optoro, a Washington, DC startup in the reverse logistics industry. Josh has been developing web applications with HTTP for 16 years and thinks that SOAs should think differently.

    Recently it has become common practise for development teams to deploy their code several times a day, as well as encouraging new developers to deploy on their first day at work.

    In our talk Mario and I will discuss how we use continous deployment to push these practises to the extreme. Automatically deploying the master branch on new changes is an awesome way to improve your development process.

    Automatically deploying master will fundamentally change how you work.

    Is app/views the worst part of your codebase? Have you ever told someone on your team "remember to update the client-side views too"? Too long has the node.js community touted their advantage of using the same code on the client and the server. It's time that Rails got a few punches in.

    We should think of views as objects, not template files. In this talk I show how that lets us tease apart presentation from data, and build logic-less templates that are shared between client and server.

    Andrew Warner studied CS and Psychology at Wesleyan. He has worked at companies large and small and with tech stacks ranging from Java/Spring to Ruby on Rails. He is currently a developer at Rap Genius, where he helps build and scale a Rails backend so that all of text can be annotated.

    If you have ever needed to scale background jobs, you might have noticed that using the database to share information between tasks incurs a serious performance penalty. Trying to process large amounts of data in real-time using the database for coordination will quickly bring your servers to their knees.

    This talk will show you how to use Apache Storm, a distributed, realtime computation system, to solve these types of problems in a fast, consistent, and fault-tolerant way.

    LYRICS:

    The screen glows white on my laptop tonight
    And my rSpec won't go green
    I'm coding in isolation
    So my PRs are obscene

    My doubts are howling
    Like this swirling storm inside
    Couldn't keep it in
    Heaven knows I've tried

    Don't let them in
    Don't let them see
    My GitHub repo's
    Mortifying me

    Conceal, don't feel
    Don't let them know!
    Oh god, you know!

    Let me code!
    Let me code!
    Can't hold it back anymore
    Let me code!
    Let me code!
    I want to play with Rails 4.0.4

    I don't care
    What they're going to say
    Let the nerds rage on
    The trolls never bothered me anyway

    It's funny how some distance
    Makes everything seem small
    And the imposter syndrome
    Can't get to me at all

    It's time to see what I can do
    To test the limits and break through
    No right, no wrong Sandi's rules for me
    I'm free!

    Let me code!
    Let me code!
    Matz is my favorite guy
    Let me code!
    Let me code!
    DHH will never see me cry

    Here I stand
    And here I'll stay
    Let the nerds rage on

    I'm watching SQL queries
    data from top down
    I'm using Ruby
    to draw frozen fractals all around
    And one thought solidifying
    Like an icy blast

    I'm never going back
    The past is in the past

    Let me code!
    Let me code!
    When I'll rise like the break of dawn
    Let me code!
    Let me code!
    That perfect girl is gone

    Here I stand
    With the apps I've made
    Let the nerds rage on
    The trolls never bothered me anyway

    Are you restarting your Rails server every time you deploy JavaScript? Are you waiting 5 minutes or more to deploy static JavaScript? Stop! We were able to cut our JavaScript front-end deployment times from more than 5 minutes to less than 15 seconds with zero downtime. As a bonus, we can preview new releases on production before making them live. I will share all the details of an approach you can implement on your Rails-backed Javascript app to make deploying JavaScript updates a joy.

    We all love Rails, and lots of us love ActiveRecord. It's intuitive and easy to use in small apps that don't have lots of models. You can select, join, and where your way into a great, working app in no time. Then your app starts to grow, you add more models, and you need to start building more and more complex queries. This talk describes how to harness the awesomeness of aRel, ActiveRecord's powerful relational algebra system, to perform arbitrarily complex queries using nothing but pure Ruby.

    When David Heinemeier Hansson started talking about REST in 2006, little could we suspect it'd become such a central part of Rails (and of web development in general). Back then a web service meant something you coded using XML and SOAP. Those were dark times. REST changed it all.

    In this talk, I'll explain REST for beginners, I'll talk about why it is such an important architecture, and I'll show all the nice things Rails offers you for building a RESTful application or a RESTful API.

    Heroku makes it quick and easy to get your app up and running without worrying about "server stuff". But that server stuff is a lot simpler than it seems and once you know it, can make your projects more flexible (and save a lot of money!).

    I'll start by looking at the basics of what's happening behind the scenes when you deploy a Rails app and why you might want to setup your own server. Then I'll look at the tools you'll need to do so and some common gotchas when getting started.

    As a new programmer, everyone tells you to build. But just as important is reading. Reading code is a powerful exercise - dissecting the source code of gems and libraries used in Rails offers the opportunity to examine patterns and design choices, while building confidence in new developers. But good code reading isn't as simple as scanning the source. The concrete guidelines outlined in this talk can maximize the benefits of your future code reading sessions and help you grow as a developer.

    Rails is a platform to serve your Ruby applications, and yet is a very well crafted open-source product written in the language that composes your apps. So, if you're curious to know how things work underneath your app, you can read everything!

    This talk will be a good guide to step into the Rails internal. We'll cover these topics:

        How Rails loads itself, libraries, and application when booting
        How Rails deals with HTTP requests and databases
        How to debug, patch, and extend Rails

    Whenever you say that you're building a web application with Ruby, its almost implied that you will be using Rails to do so.

    But imagine for a second that Rails does not exist at all. What kind of Ruby code would you write to make a web application work from scratch?

    During this talk we will think about and implement some of the MVC patterns that are taken for granted when using a framework like Rails, while at the same time write a web application with only a little help from Rack

    Rails allows us to write very concise code hiding a lot of the complexity. However, it's common to face situations that require us to write more complex code on our own, and sometimes we forget a little about what Rails can do for us. We are going through some Rails features that people might not be aware of, talking about Active Record queries, custom template handlers, routing niceties, view helpers and more, to learn how these tricks can help simplifying complex code on our apps.

This talk goes way beyond Rails.cache, it explores layered caches, discusses the CPU cost of marshaling, the latency even Memcache adds and how to dodge the unavoidable stampedes that invalidating your caches will cause.

    You have a big Rails app and are feeling the pains? Stories are hard to deliver, code is hard to refactor, and your tests take a looong time? Getting you and your codebase out of this situation requires you to stop developing a "Rails application" and start refactoring towards your domain. I will discuss how and where you refactor towards a more structured and manageable application, a component-based Rails architecture.

    In a SOA environment users can interact with multiple parts of your system, and the rules for authorization become dispersed across applications. The task of maintaining rules becomes complex. The challenge compounds further in a heterogeneous environment, with services built in different languages. In this talk, I focus on the topic of authorization, specifically how we can scale and grow our services with confidence. I'll walk through a new framework we've developed to approach this problem.

    The success of an API is measured by how fast and easy developers can integrate with that.

    In the micro-services environment, where each service has a well-defined responsibility, it's not enough to have a well designed API, it's necessary to establish a contract between the APIs, so the integration between them may be feasible.

    In this talk, I will go through a set of best practices that will help to design APIs and define a communication service contract.

    From skateboarder to runner, photographer to full stack developer, Alberto loves writing beautiful code at Globo.com, Brazil, the internet branch of the largest mass media group in South America.

    The next five years of web development are all about data applications and APIs. Learn how to leverage Rails-API to build them. This modular subset of a normal Rails application streamlines the process of building a standardized API that can easily be consumed by a wide-array of applications. We'll explore example applications using Rails API, demonstrating the expanding utility of this framework as user interfaces extend beyond HTML into native applications and APIs.

    When our tests fail all we get is output in a terminal. Testing is core to the culture of Ruby, and the tools are sophisticated, but something big is missing from the workflow. Namely, a powerful debugger.

    Integrating Pry creates an interactive, enjoyable TDD workflow. In this talk, I'll recount the somewhat unique development experience that made me a believer. I'll demonstrate with Pry a responsive and immersive TDD cycle, taking a test to green before it exits its first run.

    Does your test suite fail randomly now and then? Maybe your cucumbers are a little flakey. Maybe you're busy and just kick off the build again... and again. If you've had a week or two where the build just won't pass, you know how fragile a TDD culture is. Keep yours healthy, or start bringing it back to par today. Why do tests fail randomly? How do we hunt down the causes? We'll review known sources of "randomness", with extra focus on test pollution and integration suites.

    Our Ruby world is becoming increasingly service oriented. Even in trivial applications, we often glue on multiple services ranging from Twitter to AWS. Services can, however, be confusing to test.

    Many questions arise such as: How thoroughly should I test a service? Should I stub out responses or consume an API in test mode? How do I know a service is returning what I believe it returns?

    In this talk, I answer these questions and more so that you may test services more effectively.

    "Oh, don't ask me, I'm a terrible designer." That's something I've heard from Rails developers ever since I started working with them. But it's never true. It's just that most Rails devs don't have the scaffolding (no, not that scaffolding) around which to structure their designs.

    In this talk we'll cover the things every developer should know about design: contrast, repetition, proximity, hierarchy, flow, typography, and color.

    Jenn Scheer is a designer & developer who began designing for web but was frustrated with the inability to build it herself. She's taught design at General Assembly, to students who were clearly arming themselves for the web. She is currently at Rap Genius, helping users annotate the world.

    As developers, most of our time is spent on computers; but sometimes pen and paper is the best way to explore and develop our ideas. Sketchnoting uses hand-drawn elements to enhance focus, improve memory, and visualize important concepts. This talk will cover techniques to visually capture ideas, how to approach the mental multitasking required to sketch during technical talks and meetings, and explain why "I can't draw" is just a mental barrier to embracing creativity in your notes.

    How They Work Better Together: Lean UX, Agile Development and User-Centered Design by John Athayde

    Design has often been cut off from the development side of the house, creating static images that are then handed off to developers to build. Invariably, this waterfall approach leads to unhappy designers and frustrated programmers, and often a product that misses the mark. We'll study successes and failures from both consultancies (InfoEther, Hyphenated People, Meticulous) and product companies both large and small (LivingSocial, CargoSense).

    John Athayde is a designer and developer who spends a lot of time fighting bad coding practices in the Rails view layer. He is currently the VP of Design for CargoSense, a logistics product company. Prior to this he was the Lead for UI/UX and Front-end Development--Internal Apps at LivingSocial.

    There's no magic mojo that helps a designer notice bad design; there's no secret compendium of design mysteries that developers just don't have access to. Good interaction design is about keeping your senses honed -- noticing the little things and respecting user intuition. In this talk I won't be showing code -- I'll be breaking down the usability of the world around you, and preaching the virtues of interaction awareness. Trust me: you'll never look at a microwave the same way again.

    Client-side MVC is a different beast from the one we're used to in Rails. On the client, more than anywhere else, the M is the key to creating powerful user experiences.

    To demonstrate this principle in action, we'll first create an in-memory model of what a color is, and then use it to build an interactive 3D color chooser that is both beautiful and intuitive.

    Sound hard? Not with when you're armed with well defined models... not when you've got the Power of M on your side.

    Presentations I give, regardless of topic, grind to a halt once I mention pairing. Do we pair all day? Who owns the code? How do I convince my boss to let us pair? When do you take bathroom breaks? What about remote pairing? Pairing is a scam!

    I'll answer all questions, from the poignant to the silly, and want you to share your own pair programming experiences. Ask me anything!

    Last year, DHH said "good frameworks are extractions, not inventions." The success of Rails lets us forget its roots as an extraction from an HTML-based UI. The failure of Rails has been its perception as "best web framework ever" instead of "best web framework for apps like Basecamp". Given that, it's clear why Rails makes writing a UI in HTML a joy but does few favors for JavaScript-heavy apps. Joy can be had in JavaScript, and we'll show how with Lineman.js & tools extracted to help find it!

    Justin Searls has two professional passions: writing great software and sharing what he's learned in order to help others write even greater software. He and his team at Test Double have the pleasure of living out both passions every day, working closely with clients to find simple solutions to complex problems.

    While there are resources on why other companies have made the transition to SOA, and end-game service boundaries may be clear, there are few resources on how to make progress towards SOA without sinking an entire team or stopping concurrent product development. Faced with a growing codebase, slower tests and performance issues, we've extracted services from our large Rails app the way we do everything else: iteratively. I'll walk through what we did right, and what we almost did wrong.

    It took a while for Eric to come around to programming, trying a few other careers first. Now he focuses on the intersection of code and process, using buzzwords such as TDD, agile and devops to describe his ham-fisted hammering on keyboards. He finds it most interesting when code fails, and why.

    Experienced developers tend to build up a library of creative problem-solving tools: rubber ducks, code smells, anthropomorphizing code, &c.

    These tools map abstract problems into forms our brains are good at solving. But our brains are also good at lying to us.

    We'll talk about some of these tools, when to use them (or not), and how their biases can lead us astray.

    I think a lot of developers secretly harbor the desire to start their own company, but don't realize that running a business means a lot more than just cutting great code all day long. Others may be at a point in their career where they feel stalled out and might want to see if management is right for them. Moving from a software role to a management role doesn't mean you have to sacrifice all your technical/coding skills, but it does mean you need to cultivate some new ones.

    Jessie is the Director of Engineering at Lookingglass Cyber Solutions. She enjoys mentoring young developers and is an active coach and participant with RailsGirls. Though she mostly spends her day herding cats, on occasion her devs let her into the code repo to do some damage.

    Twilio's distributed architecture makes manually tracking down a communication bottleneck or failure almost impossible. By utilizing a distributed tracing system, Twilio can follow any request through each service layer and each host. In this talk, we will demonstrate how a Rails application can gain the same insights by instrumenting a multi-tier application and investigate tracing integration into a larger distributed ecosystem.

    Kenny Hoxworth is a software engineer at Twilio dedicated to the reliable delivery of messaging communication. He previously co-founded a cyber-security company in Baltimore, Maryland, where he helped design and build the company's Rails flagship application and backend technology stack.

    Are you from a non-C.S. background? What about someone you mentor? Many junior devs' top focus is building technical knowledge. However, they already have other skills that can help them in their roles immediately! Some of these include helping their team focus on the right tasks and working well with stakeholders like PM and support. This talk will discuss the non-technical contributions junior devs can make now and how their senior dev mentors can help them ramp up more quickly as a result.

    I studied Biology in college and was all set to attend medical school and fulfill my mother's dream of my becoming a doctor. Instead, I got a job at Google in tech support. After five years at Google, I took a sabbatical to attend Hackbright Academy. Now I'm a junior developer at New Relic.

Using a combination of this robust hardware and software solution, we were able to successfully track, monitor and provide real time reporting on the well-being of hives from across the county. Find out how we used ruby, rails, solar panels and other libraries to provide insight into this problem.

    Are your controllers jumbled with seemingly unrelated steps? Does testing any bit of application logic require fixtures and setup helpers a mile long?

    Evented patterns create a vocabulary of what happens in your system, and a way to separate code triggering events from code that responds to them. That helps tame the sprawl by setting clean boundaries, simplifying tests, and keeping your dependencies isolated.

    This talk reveals the power of events and what's already in Rails to help you.

    When you work with Rails every day, it's easy to forget how much it changed web development. But the influence of Rails is still being felt today in the Ruby world and beyond. Let's rediscover the Rails revolution by looking backward at its impact on how we work now.

    Writing small classes is hard. You know you should, but how? It's so much easier to write a large class. In this talk we'll build up a set of small classes starting from nothing using a set of directed refactorings applied as we build, all while keeping our tests green. We'll identify abstractions yearning to be free of their big class cages. In the process we'll also see how basic patterns such as composition, delegation and dependency inversion emerge from using small objects.

    Theory tells us to build applications out of small, interchangeable objects but reality often supplies the exact opposite. Many apps contain huge classes of long methods and hair-raising conditionals; they're hard to understand, difficult to reuse and costly to change. This talk takes an ugly section of conditional code and converts it into a few simple objects. It bridges the gap between OO theory and practice and teaches straightforward strategies that all can use to improve their code.

    Sandi Metz, author of "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby", believes in simple code and straightforward explanations. She prefers working software, practical solutions and lengthy bicycle trips (not necessarily in that order) and consults and teaches on all things OOP.

    Wizards have been common in web applications since the dawn of the Internet, with the most popular example being the Shopping Cart, yet many struggle with writing wizard code effectively, resulting in a huge untraceable rat's nest of copy/paste code.

    In 1961, MIT was awarded the contract for a guidance system to fly to the moon, the first for the entire Apollo Program. Software was not mentioned. Six years later, the project had 400 engineers writing code.

    The Apollo Guidance Computer flew men to the moon before UNIX or C were created, and is to this day a marvel of engineering.

    NASA and MIT records of its creation allow us to look back on some pioneers of our industry, relive their experiences, and maybe learn a few things ourselves.

    Julian Simioni is a software developer at 42floors in San Francisco, CA. When not working tirelessly to bring technology to the world of commercial real estate, he can be found riding his bicycle, flying planes, and eating spaghetti.

    A detailed, deep-diving, in-the-deep-end and occasionally humorous whirlwind introduction and analysis of a suite of modern (and sometimes delightfully archaic) database technologies. How they work, why they work, and when you might want them to work in your Rails application.

    Including but not limited to:

        PostgreSQL (now with JSON!)
        Redis
        Cassandra
        Hyperdex
        MongoDb
        Riak
        Animated Gifs

    Toby is a mild-mannered Rails Developer & occasionally Polyglot Programmer, based in Sydney, Australia.

    He really likes databases.

    Toby's hobbies include collecting programming languages and databases, playing the drums, cutting code and pondering the nature of existence.

    Ruby on Rails applications do not need to require the files that define their classes and modules. In development mode, code changes take effect without restarting the server. How's that possible? This talk explains how this works in depth.

    You'll come out with a deep understanding of how constants work in Ruby, constant autoloading in Rails, how and why does it differ from Ruby's builtin algorithms, and how class reloading is implemented.

    Rails has opinions about how we should organize code, interact with a database, write tests, format URLs... just about everything. These conventions, the wisdom goes, free us up to focus on the specifics of our application. "Convention over configuration" becomes our mantra as development hurtles forward with startling speed.

    At some point, we stop. We take stock of what we've built, and it's a mess. How did we get here?

    Turns out, the decisions that Rails made for us had consequences.

    Ernie's been writing code since he was 6 years old, but only getting paid to do so for the past 16 years or so. Sometimes he still can't believe people actually pay us to have this much fun.

    Launched just two years ago, Upworthy has quickly become one of the most popular sites on the Web. According to Quantcast, it's a Top 40 site in the U.S. and is the most visited site hosted on Heroku. And yes, it's powered by Ruby on Rails! Hear the story of how Upworthy started out as a modest Sinatra app, then moved to a monolithic Rails app, and has now been broken up into a set of services powered by Rails. Technical decision-making in the midst of massive growth will be described in detail.

    Luigi is the founding engineer at Upworthy, a viral media site that aims to drive massive amounts of attention to the topics that matter most. Before Upworthy, Luigi was a software developer at the Sunlight Foundation. He also co-organizes Code for Atlanta.

    Ryan is a Senior Engineer at Upworthy. In 2012 Ryan was an Engineer on the Technology Team at Obama For America that helped re-elect the President of the United States. Prior to OFA, Ryan was a 2011 Inaugural Code for America Fellow and then went on to become Technical Lead at Code for America.

    Rails applications come together quickly in the beginning. Drop all these gems in and voila! Overtime test slow down and the productivity is gone. Have you ever questioned why? The framework was used incorrectly. Rails is not your application. It's a delivery mechanism. This talk is about leveraging different design patterns, roles, and boundaries to implement the business logic before even thinking about rails new.

    Elixir provides the joy and productivity of Ruby with the concurrency and fault-tolerance of Erlang. Together, we'll take a guided tour through the language, going from the very basics to macros and distributed programming. Along the way, we'll see how Elixir embraces concurrency and how we can construct self-healing programs that restart automatically on failure. Attendees should leave with a great head-start into Elixir, some minor language envy, and a strong desire to continue exploration.

    Don't you hate when testing takes 3x as long because your specs are hard to understand? Or when testing conditional permutation leads to a ton of duplication? Following a few simple patterns, you can easily take a bloated spec and make it readable, DRY and simple to extend. This workshop is a refactor kata. We will take a bloated sample spec and refactor it to something manageable, readable and concise.

    Your job doesn't start when your fingers touch the keyboard. It starts when someone utters the words: "How hard would it be?"

    This is a crash course in estimating work, identifying hidden costs, and dealing with constraints. Along the way we will also learn how to defend against tricks from the Dark Side such as estimation bargaining, ego manipulation, and crunch time.

    They taught me Big-O notation, I wish they taught me this.

    I'm a full stack Rails developer at LiquidPlanner, and have been writing software that helps people get work done for the past dozen years. You'll find me running, walking, biking and eating about town.

    If you build it, they might come. We all want our open source projects to be widely adopted, but competition in the open source landscape is fierce. Reaching levels of notoriety and adoption akin to the likes of Linux, Rails, or WordPress is increasingly challenging amongst today's volume of seemingly never-ending options. How do you differentiate in a way that is meaningful? It's really about building a 'who', not just a 'what'.

    RailsConf 2018: The GraphQL Way: A new path for JSON APIs by Nick Quaranto

    Have you written JSON APIs in Rails a few times? Even if you’re escaped implementing a “render: :json” call, some day soon you’ll need to get JSON data out to a native client or your front-end framework. Your Rails apps might change, but the pitfalls for JSON APIs stay the same: They’re hard to discover, difficult to change from the client side, and documenting them is a pain. For your next app, or your current one, let’s consider GraphQL. I'll show you how to implement it in your app and offer real-world advice from making it work in an existing Rails app.

    Creating truly 100% accessible websites often requires specialized knowledge of the ins and outs of screen reader settings, browser defaults and HTML quirks, yet most of us still need to google how to turn on a screen reader. We attend "Web Accessibility 101" seminars and workshops over and over but very few of us end up with the kind of specialized knowledge necessary to make truly accessible websites. In this talk, we'll discuss why this is, and how we can eventually get to accessibility 102.

    Understanding indexes is key to demystifying database performance, and will have huge impact on one's ability to plan, contribute, and troubleshoot as one progresses in their career. Having said all that: many engineers still don’t really know what indexes ARE. Most simply know what indexes can DO. This presentation takes a look at the most commonly used index for any RDBMS: the B-tree. We will pull apart the data structure, discuss how it works, and briefly touch on some of the algorithms they use. With this baseline established, we will revisit a few common assumptions about indexes.

    RailsConf 2018: Continuous Deployments and Data Sovereignty: A Case Study by Mike Calhoun

    In any production rails application’s simplest form, there is one version of the app deployed to a single host or cloud provider of your choice, but what if there were laws and regulations in place that required your application to be replicated and maintained within the geographical boundaries of other countries. This is a requirement of countries that have data sovereignty laws and a regular hurdle to overcome when dealing with sensitive data such as protected health information. This talk provides a case study of how we devised an automatic deployment strategy to deploy to multiple countries.

    A good test suite can help you catch errors in development, but how do you know if your code starts misbehaving in production?

    In this talk, we’ll learn about checkups: a powerful and flexible way to ensure that your code continues to work as intended after you deploy. Through real-world examples, we’ll see how adding a simple suite of checkups to your app can help you detect unforeseen issues, including tricky problems like race conditions and data corruption. We’ll even look at how checkups can mitigate much larger disasters in real-time. Come give your app’s health a boost!

    Devly, a multi-service development environment
    Writing a system alone is hard. Building many systems with many people is harder.

    As our company has grown, we tried many approaches to user-friendly, shared development environments and learned what works and what doesn't. We incorporated what we learned into a tool called devly. Devly is used to develop products at Fastly that span many services written in different languages.

    We learned that the design of our tools must be guided by how teams work and communicate. To respond to these needs, Devly allows self-service, control, and safety so that developers can focus on their work.

    One day I joined a team maintaining a huge, legacy, and slow Rails app. We thought that we have to optimize the application throughput for the user happiness, and so we formed a task force that focuses on the performance.

    Now, here's the record of the team's battle, including how we inspected and measured the app, how we found the bottlenecks, and how we tackled each real problem, about the following topics:

    Tuning Ruby processes
    Finding slow parts inside Rails, and significantly improving them
    Fixing existing slow libraries, or crafting ultimately performant alternatives

    Rails brings us a lot of useful tools out-of-the-box, but there are missing parts too. For example, for such essential tasks as authorization we are on our own. Even if we choose a trending OSS solution, we still have to care about the way to keep our code maintainable, efficient, and, of course, bug-less. Working on Rails projects, I've noticed some common patterns in designing access systems as well as useful code techniques I'd like to share with you in this talk.

    We'll cover several anti-patterns in the use of booleans. We'll discuss why they're problematic, and explore some better alternatives.

    Ugh, documentation.

    It's the afterthought of every system, scrambled together in the final days before launch, updated sparingly, generally out of date.

    What if we could programmatically verify that our API documentation was accurate? What if this helped us build more intuitive APIs by putting our users first? What if documentation came first, and helped us write our code?

    With Swagger and Apivore as our weapons of choice, we'll write documentation that will make your APIs better, your clients more satisfied, and you happier.

    On March 28, 1979 at exactly 4:00am, control rods flew into the reactor core of Three Mile Island Unit #2. A fault in the cooling system had tripped the reactor. At 4:02, the emergency cooling system automatically kicked in as reactor temperature continued to climb. At 4:04, one of the operators switched the emergency cooling system off, dooming the reactor to partial meltdown. Why?

Yet, why would we want to do this? What’s the purpose of adding Webpack to Rails, and what’s the advantage of utilizing it? How does this affect javascript frameworks that aren’t Webpack friendly? In this talk, we’ll explore these ideas as well as the future of client side integrations into Rails.

    RailsConf 2018: Using Databases to pull your applications weight by Harisankar P S

    Most Rails applications out there in the world deal with the manipulation and presentation of data. So the speed of our application is proportional to how fast we can work with data. Rails is good with presenting data. And our Database is the one who is good at processing data. But we sometimes make the mistake of just using the database as a file cabinet, and using ruby to process. The database is built for crunching data and returning to us the results that we need. This talk is about how to optimize your database so as to speed up your existing Rails application.

    Content warning: This talk includes brief stories about sexual assault and IEDs in Iraq.

    Fear is not a gut feeling. Fear is your brain delivering critical information derived from countless cues that have added up to one conclusion. Stop. Get out. Run.

    But sometimes fear isn’t life or death. Often, it’s code smell. It’s a bad feeling before a deploy. This talk will explore fear, instinct and denial. We’ll focus on our two brains — what Daniel Kahneman describes as System 1 and System 2. And we’ll look at how we can start to view “feelings” as pre-incident indicators.

    Have you ever been frustrated with code that is sprinkled with poorly named classes, methods, and variables?

    One of the most valuable things you can do as a developer is to choose good names and to sensitize your teammates to the benefits of improving names.

    It turns out that improving names is deeply connected to improving design. And vice-versa. You will see and experience this deep connection as we explore a real world example.

    By the end of this talk, you will have learned a process to get you started with improving names and improving design—a process simple enough for you to teach others.

    Individuals can only advance when they know they are valued, listened to, and understood. Without having lived the same life as them, it's often hard to understand why people do what they do. It requires empathy, and practicing empathy can be tough when someone differs greatly from you, personally or professionally. But, being empathetic can be learned, for instance through method acting.

    Let's talk about the fascinating acting techniques of Stanislavski, Strasberg, Adler & Meisner, and learn how you too can employ the Method to better understand (and work with) the people in your life.

    The idea that confidence is solely the result of positive self-talk is circular: If I believed in my ability to talk myself up, I would. But if I did, I wouldn't need to talk myself up. It's not as simple as having faith.

    There's a thread amongst all peak performers and skilled practitioners: specific habits, routines, and processes that wrap uncertainty and create confidence. Oscar-winning actors rehearse, pro-drivers do laps, chefs prep.

    This talk will help you recognize and design habits, routines, and practices that embed confidence into the body.

You've probably heard of or maybe used Devise: all you have to do is add it to your Gemfile and run a generator, and you have a robust authentication system.

    Behind the scenes, Devise uses Warden to handle authentication. In this talk, I'll explain what Warden is, why it's useful and how Devise takes advantage of it to build the most popular authentication gem for Rails.

    RailsConf 2018: The Evolution of Rails Security by Justin Collins

    Rails has a reputation for being secure by default, but how deserved is that reputation? Let's take a look back at some of the low points in Rails security history: from the first Rails CVE, to the controversial GitHub mass assignment, the 2013 Rails apocalypse, and more recent remote code execution issues. Then we'll cheer ourselves up with the many cool security features Rails has added over the years! We'll cover auto-escaping, strong parameters, default security headers, secret storage, and less well-known features like per-form CSRF tokens and upcoming Content Security Policy support.

    RailsConf 2018: The Code-Free Developer Interview by Pete Holiday

    When it comes to evaluating candidates for software engineering roles, it's hard to keep up with the latest and greatest techniques. We know logic puzzles don't work. Writing pseudocode on a white board is so tired and cliche at this point that companies brag about not doing that. Teams have resorted to what seems like an obvious choice at first blush: just have the candidate write some code. This new trend may have some unintended consequences, though.

    In this talk, you'll learn how to design an interview process which allows you to evaluate candidates without making them code for you.

Well, what you say and how you say it impacts how you are understood and how others perceive you. In written communication, a single missing comma can wildly change the meaning of what you said. In this talk, we'll walk through 5 tips that improve how you communicate. Using real world examples, we'll show how common these pitfalls are and how to overcome them. You'll leave armed with the ability to positively impact your relationships through how you communicate.

This talk will explore how to automate the integration of human-work directly into a RoR app, by enabling background workers to request and retrieve data from actual human workers. The secret is Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing marketplace connecting ‘requesters’ who post tasks with ‘workers’ who complete them. Attendees will learn how to automate the completion of human tasks (e.g. price research, image tagging, sentiment analysis, etc) with impressive speed, accuracy and scalability.

    So you have something new to sell: maybe your first book or a hip new SaaS. How do you decide the price? How do you know you're not overpricing? Or underpricing? Why, oh why, did you ever think to sell something?!

    Instead of choosing a number by looking inward at your costs, you can use what programmers use best: an abstraction! You'll learn a model for picking the right price for your product and what that price communicates so you can confidently price your next great invention. You'll leave with an actionable list of next steps for pricing your future projects.

They're stuck on the long, slow Ramp of Death.

    Coming to you live from the trenches of running an organically growing SaaS for five years, this is an honest –and sometimes brutal– story of perseverance, sacrifice and reward. Find out how to overcome the ramp, and why it isn't as bad as you might think.

    Quick and easy browser testing using RSpec and Rails 5.1 by Sam Phippen

    Traditionally doing a full stack test of a Rails app with RSpec has been problematic. The browser wouldn't automate, capybara configuration would be a nightmare, and cleaning up your DB was difficult. In Rails 5.1 the new 'system test' type was added to address this. With modern RSpec and Rails, testing every part of your stack including Javascript from a browser is now a breeze.

    In this talk, you'll learn about the new system specs in RSpec, how to set them up, and what benefits they provide. If you want to improve your RSpec suite with full stack testing this talk is for you!

    6 degrees of JavaScript on Rails by Michael Crismali

    How much JavaScript you include in your Rails application can feel like a choice between basically none or a full JavaScript single page application backed by a Rails API. When you have a team of people whose confidence with JavaScript is all over the place, this can feel like an impossible choice. Fortunately, there are many options in the middle that can allow those with less JavaScript confidence to stretch and grow while those with more confidence can build UI components with fewer constraints.

    Perhaps you've thought about switching to Webpack. Then you open a Webpack config file and your heart sinks; it looks like an alien life-form. You try to get it working, but your old jQuery plugins won't even load in the browser.

    Moving from Webpack basics to using it in production means understanding how it works. We'll demystify how Webpack bundles assets for the browser, how it differs from the Rails asset pipeline, and highlight common challenges that may occur coming from Sprockets.

    This is the talk we would have wanted to see before recently adopting Webpack in our own Rails app.

    Ten years of Rails upgrades by Jordan Raine

    Upgrading Rails can go from easy-to-hard quickly. If you've struggled to upgrade to a new version of Rails, you're not alone. And yet, with useful deprecation warnings and extensive beta periods, Rails has never made it easier to upgrade. So what makes it hard?

    By looking at the past ten years of Rails upgrades at Clio (and other notable apps), let's see what we can learn. Gain insight into the tradeoffs between different timelines and approaches and learn practical ways to keep your app up-to-date.

    Stop Testing, Start Storytelling by Mike Schutte

    Stop trying to be a computer; you're a human! You know what humans are good at? Storytelling. Stop trying to write tests just to get a green test suite, and start telling rich, descriptive stories. Once you have a good story, then you can worry about the implementation details (wait, is testing a form of abstraction and encapsulation?!). In this talk, we look at writing tests as simply telling stories to the test suite. By telling stories about the application (methods, controllers, features, &c.) the suite holds the storyteller accountable for making those stories become, and stay, true.

    Engineering Engineering: More than the sum of our parts by Vietor Davis

    Applying the tried and true answers of “It depends.”, “Maybe?”, and “It works for me, what if you try …” to our engineering organizations themselves turns out to work better than trying to find the One True Way. We all know that every engineering project is full of trade-offs, caveats, surprising complexities, and hidden depths; so it should be no surprise that we, the engineers who build such systems, are at least as complicated.

    Minitest 6: test feistier! by Ryan Davis

    Minitest 5 ships with ruby and is the standard test framework for rails. It already provides a traditional unit test framework, spec DSL, mocks, stubs, test randomization, parallelization, machine agnostic benchmarking, and tons of assertions all in under 2kloc. So what would Minitest 6 do differently? Hopefully to the end user, not much will change, and yet it will be worlds apart from Minitest 5. Come see how you can massively speed up your rails test runs and improve your testing practices by upgrading your test framework.

    LendingHome is on a mission to simplify the mortgage process, but that’s not always easy in a world where we hear “API? What’s that?” from our third-party vendors. For the ones that do have technology solutions the phrases “FTP” and “Fixed-Width” are frequently thrown around.

    This talk will dive into the solutions we’ve built that abstract away some of these concepts and how we provide clean interfaces for these services to the rest of the organization. If you’ve ever wanted to learn how modern companies interface with the old, this is the talk for you.

    Re-graphing The Mental Model of The Rails Router by Vaidehi Joshi

    Rails is incredibly powerful because of its abstractions. For years, developers have been able to hit the ground running and be productive without having to know the in's and out's of the core computer science concepts that fuel this framework. But just because something is hidden away doesn't mean that it's not worth knowing! In this talk, we'll unpack the CS fundamentals that are used in the Rails router. Together, we'll demystify the graph data structure that lies under the hood of the router in order to understand how a simple structure allows for routing to actually work in a Rails app.

    Rails 5.2 ships with a new library to support file uploads: Active Storage.

    In this talk, we will analyze its internal code, learning how it integrates with Active Record and Action Pack to supply amazing features out of the box, from image previews to cloud storage.

    We will review its class architecture and delve into the implementation of several Active Storage methods, such as has_one_attached and upload. On the way, we will better understand some Ruby patterns frequently used within Rails: meta-programming, macros, auto-loading, initializers, class attributes.

    Ruby: A Family History by Geoffrey Litt

    Rails is made possible by Ruby’s unique combination of deep dynamism and pragmatic elegance. In turn, Ruby inherited many of its core ideas from older languages including Lisp, Smalltalk, and Perl.

    In this talk, we’ll take a tour of these languages and their myriad influences on Ruby, to better understand the foundations of our tools, improve our ability to use them to their full potential, and imagine how they might be further improved.

    Five Sharding Data Models and Which is Right by Craig Kerstiens

    Sharding is a heated topic and many who have tried it have come away with a bad taste in their mouth. But it's also well proven that sharding your database is the true way to scale the data layer. From Instagram to Google to Salesforce, with large-enough data and with sufficiently demanding performance requirements, you need to shard in order to scale out. Using the lens of the Postgres open source database, I'll walk you through things to keep in mind to be successful with sharding, and which data model is the right approach for you.

    RailsConf 2018: Here's to history: programming through archaeology by Eleanor Kiefel Haggerty

    Does your git log output resemble an archaeological site from 500BC? Ransacked by Persians with some Spartan conflict? When we code and commit, our decisions, for better or worse, are preserved. As though in an archaeological record. Thanks to the archaeological record we can understand entire human cultures, but how much do we understand about the decisions developers are making today? Applying the same practices archaeologists utilise can help us understand the decisions developers are making in 2018.

    RailsConf 2018:Knobs, buttons & switches: Operating your application at scale by Amy Unger

    Pilots have the flight deck, Captain Kirk had his bridge, but what do you have for managing failure in your application?

    Every app comes under stress, whether it's from downstream failures to unmaintainable high load to a spike in intensive requests. We'll cover code patterns you can use to change the behavior of your application on the fly to gracefully fail.

    You’ll walk away from this talk with tools you can have on hand to ensure you remain in control even when your application is under stress.

    RailsConf 2018: Here’s to the crazy ones by James Adam

    Have you ever had a crazy idea that you were quietly convinced was great, but that everyone else thought was dumb? Well guess what: the future of Rails is depending on you.

    I’d like rewind time by more than ten years, to tell you about one particular crazy idea that almost everyone hated, until it quietly became one of the core architectural components of Rails.

    At the same time, we’ll meet the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels and the trouble makers that ended up shaping Rails as we know it… and maybe, just maybe, we will realise that we can be one of them too.

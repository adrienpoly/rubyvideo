    We will talk about introspection features of Ruby interpreter (MRI) to solve troubles on your Ruby on Rails application. Rails application development with Ruby is basically fast and easy. However, when you have trouble such as tough bugs in your app, performance issues and memory consumption issues, they are difficult to solve without tooling. In this presentation, I will show you what kind of introspection features MRI has and how to use them with your Rails application.

    Performance regressions in edge Rails versions happen quite often, and are sometimes introduced even by experienced Core commiters. The Rails team doesn’t have any tools to get notified about this kind of regressions yet. This is why I’ve built RailsPerf, a regression detection tool for Rails. It resembles a continuous integration service in a way: it runs benchmarks after every commit in Rails repo to detect any performance regressions. I will speak about building a right set of benchmarks, isolating build environments, and I will also analyze some performance graphs for major Rails versions

    RSpec is often described with the word “magic” by both its users and its detractors.

    Understanding how RSpec matchers, doubles, and specifications work will help you as an RSpec user. You will be able to take advantage of RSpec’s flexibility to make your tests clearer and more expressive. You’ll also get some exposure to new RSpec features, like compound matchers.

    Walking through a typical RSpec example, we’ll show the RSpec internals as RSpec evaluates matchers and uses doubles. You’ll leave with a better understanding of how to harness RSpec in your own tests.

    practices. Rails 4.0 switched to minitest 4, Rails 4.1 switched to minitest 5,
    and Rails 4.2 switched to randomizing the test run order. I'll explain what has
    happened, explain the motivation behind the changes, and how to diagnose and solve
    problems you may have as you upgrade. Whether you use minitest already, are considering
    switching, or just use rspec and are curious what's different, this talk will

The experts in this session have analyzed thousands of interviews and will share how to create a great candidate experience in your company and how to scale your teams effectively. Candidates can use these same lessons to prepare for interviews and evaluate the companies interviewing them.

    Rails apps start out quickly and beautifully, but after a year features are a struggle, tests are slow, developers are grinding, and stakeholders are unhappy. "Skinny controllers and fat models" hasn't worked, and "use service objects!" is awfully vague.

    This talk explains how to compact the "big ball of mud" at the heart of your app into a bedrock of reliable code. It gives the steps to incrementally refactor models into a functional core and gives explicit rules for how to write light, reliable tests.

But this philosophy is rarely extended to the code we write. We'll take a look at some principles of UX and Interface Design and relate them back to our code. By comparing code that gets it right to code that gets it desperately wrong, we'll learn some principles that we can use to write better, more usable code.

    Code reviews are not about catching bugs. Modern code reviews are about socialization, learning, and teaching.

    How can you get the most out of a peer's code review and how can you review code without being seen as overly critical? Reviewing code and writing easily-reviewed features are skills that will make you a better developer and a better teammate.

    You will leave this talk with the tools to implement a successful code-review culture. You'll learn how to get more from the reviews you're already getting and how to have more impact with the reviews you leave.

    There's a problem with this story: We are humans, developing software with humans, to benefit humans. And humans are messy.

    We wrap ourselves in process, trying to trade people for personas, points, planning poker, and the promise of predictability. Only people aren't objects to be abstracted away. Let's take some time to think through the trade offs we're making together.

    Fostering diversity is a commonly cited goals for the tech community, and - let's be honest - the liberal arts are kicking our butts at it. This was not always the case, though; until very recently, the faces of the liberal arts were exclusively white and male. This changed thanks to distinct strategies and deliberate cultural shifts brought about in the late 20th century, some of which the tech community has copied and others we can use more effectively. In this talk, we will explore some of those strategies by examining the education, history, and culture of the liberal arts.

I'll demonstrate how using Docker containers and Kubernetes allows you to be lazy and get back to building cool features (or watching cat videos). I'll go over some of the pros and cons to the "lazy" way and I'll show how these tools can be used by both simple and complex apps.

    Like an espresso, code is better served in small portions. Unfortunately most of the time we build systems consisting of a monolithic application that gets bigger and scarier by the day. Fortunately there are a few ways to solve this problem.

    Everyone talks about how good microservices are. At a first glance an architecture of small independently deployable services seems ideal, but it's no free lunch, it comes with some drawbacks.

    In this talk we'll see how microservices help us think differently about writing code and solving problems, and why they are not always the right answer.

    begin testing the same behaviour. This is problematic.

    In this talk we'll cover the most common types of test you'll encounter in your Rails applications: feature,
    controller and model. We'll also talk about ways you can design your tests to
    ensure your suite is robust to changes in your system. If you'd love to learn

Once you learn how to build your own SVG graphics then it's possible to do cool things like cache them, or use your own CSS and JavaScript to manipulate them. This presentation will show you how.

    When we want to offer customizability to the users of our applications, things can get tricky. How do we allow users to customize the look of the user interface while reusing the static CSS we’ve already designed?

    There is a way, but it is fraught with many dangers. Learn about the power of dynamically generating CSS from Sass files. Tackle the foes of dynamic content injection, rendering, caching, and background processing. In the end, we will look triumphantly at our ability to reuse our application styles to create customizable interfaces for our end users.

    While most parts of Rails have been thoroughly overhauled during the past few years, one part has stubbornly refused improvement. The view layer is still by default using ERB to transform your app’s objects into HTML. While trying to solve a seemingly unrelated problem we discovered a design that suddenly enabled us to move past the limitations of ERB while still integrating closely with Rails. We could now separate presentation logic from display structure; reason about our views and how they relate; and dramatically improve our code. We called the library Curly, and it's pretty awesome.

    We talk about bringing new developers "up to speed quickly." Imposter syndrome is bad enough, but often junior developers feel pressured to learn faster and produce more. Developers often focus on velocity as the critical measure of success. The need for speed actually amplifies insecurities, magnifies imposter syndrome, and hinders growth. Instead let's talk about how we can track and plan progress using meaningful goals and metrics.

    Ruby is a productive language that developers love. When Ruby isn't fast enough, they often fall back to writing C extensions. But C extensions are scary for a number of reasons; it's easy to leak memory, or segfault the entire process. When we started to look at writing parts of the Skylight agent using native code, Rust was still pretty new, but its promise of low-level control with high-level safety intrigued us. We'll cover the reasons we went with Rust, how we structured our code, and how you can do it too. If you're looking to expand your horizons, Rust may be the language for you.

    to the web? Most developers don't consider that someone with visual impairments
    may use the web and don't think about what this experience may be like for someone
    who has a visual impairment. The current trend is to push access-driven design
    to the end of feature building, but we will explore why this needs to be a top

    Rails comes with many powerful security protections out of the box, but no code is perfect. This talk will highlight a new approach to web app security, one focusing on a higher level of abstraction than current techniques. We will take a look at current security processes and tools and some common vulnerabilities still found in many Rails apps. Then we will investigate novel ways to protect against these vulnerabilities.

    So you are building an app that has a ton of forms each with tons of fields. Your heart sinks as you think of writing and managing all those models, migrations and associations. PostgreSQL JSON column and ActiveRecord::Store to the rescue! This talk covers a way to wrap these Rails 4 features to simplify the building of extensive hierarchical data models. You will learn to expressively declare schema-less attributes on your model that act much like “real" columns, meaning they are typecast, validated, query able, embeddable, and behave with Rails form builders.

    Developers are trained to communicate to things with a goal in mind. When you're talking to something like, say a computer, you type in your code and it responds by giving you back what you want. Simple and straight-forward. Talking to humans? That's more of a challenge. Why? Because communicating with people requires a special set of skills - namely, empathy and a little bit of storytelling. In an industry filled with brilliant minds, great ideas and mass disruption, so few of the best and brightest know how to tell their compelling story. This workshop will teach you how.

    When you want to talk to someone, where do you turn? Skype? Slack or HipChat? Maybe even an old-fashioned telephone? As great (or not) as these are, they all fail in one important way: Context. As developers, why don’t we enable our users to communicate where they are doing everything else, right inside the browser or mobile app? The technology to make contextual communications is evolving quickly with exciting technologies like WebRTC, speech recognition and natural language processing. This talk is about how to apply those building blocks and bring contextual communication to your apps.

    ActiveJob is a great addition to Rails (in 4.2) providing a standard interface to various asynchronous gems (Delayed_Job/Sidekiq etc). Has it also ushered in something else? A way to do 'Service Objects' the 'Rails Way'?

We’re good at caching static content like images and scripts, but taking the next step - caching dynamic and user-specific content - is confusing and often requires a leap of faith. In this talk you’ll learn new and old strategies for caching dynamic content, HTTP performance rules to live by, and a better understanding of how to accelerate any application. This is just what the doctor ordered: a prescription for cache money.

    Payments applications typically require a strong audit trail, very predictable failure behavior and strong transactional integrity. In Ruby/Rails, ActiveRecord allows any part of the code to modify anything in the database, failures are often silently ignored, and database transactions are hidden for convenience by default. In this talk I'll explore how to solve those problems and use RoR to build a large scale payments system.

    Did you know that Shakespeare wrote almost no direction into his plays? No fight direction. No staging. No notes to the songs. Of the 1700 words he created, there was no official dictionary. That’s right the author of some of the greatest literary works in history, which were filled with situational complexity, fight sequences and music, include NO documentation! How did he do it?

    Every once a while, Rails might behave in strange ways that you did not expect, and it could be difficult to figure out what is really going on. Was it a bug in the framework? Could it be one of the gems I am using? Did I do something wrong? In this session, we will look at some tips, tricks and tools to help you debug your Rails issues. Along the way, you will also learn how to dive into the Rails codebase without getting lost. The next time you a mysterious bug finds its way into your Rails applications, you will be well-equipped to pry open the black box yourself!

    The most useful APIs are simple and composeable. Omnipotent DSLs can be great, but sometimes we want to just write Ruby. We're going to look at the process of designing a new API for attributes and type casting in Rails 5.0, and why simpler is better. We'll unravel some of the mysteries behind the internals of Active Record. After all, Rails is ultimately just a large legacy code base. In this talk you'll learn about the process of finding those simple APIs which are begging to be extracted, and the refactoring process that can be used to tease them out slowly.

    Developers often refer to their trade as both “art” and “craft," using the two interchangeably. Yet, the terms traditionally refer to different ends of the creative spectrum. So what is code? Art or craft?

    Come explore these questions in this interdisciplinary talk: What is art versus craft? How does coding fit in once we make this distinction? Is the metaphor we use to describe coding even important––and why? You’ll walk away from this discussion with a better understanding of what creating and programming means to you, and what it could mean to others.

No matter how deep performance testing data are, developers are still at a loss when asked to derive meaningful and actionable data that pinpoint to bottlenecks in the application. You know things are slow, but you are left with the challenge of figuring out where to optimize. This presentation describes a new kind of analytics, called performance analytics, that provide tangible ways to root cause performance problems in today’s applications and clearly identify where and what to optimize.

    We all run into legacy code. Sometimes, we even write it ourselves. Working with legacy code can be a daunting challenge, but there are ways to tackle it without taking on the risk of a full rewrite.

    There is a deep satisfaction that comes from conquering a nasty piece of legacy code. The ability to achieve this goal depends on both testing and refactoring.

    We'll learn how baby-step refactoring techniques lead to a better understanding of the code and a high-quality design while always keeping the code running.

    A gentleman wizard and his sarcastic manservant examine a common anti-pattern in schema design, in which indexes are “left for later”. The pitfalls and dangers of this approach are set forth. Right incantations (which is to say, scenarios and sample code) for battling this devious tendency will be presented, with all magic (that is, “buzz”) words thoroughly demystified and clearly explained. Walk away with a new understanding of why your application tables deserve indexes from day one, and how to make sure you’ve got them covered.

    We're web developers. But how well do we know the web's core protocol, HTTP? In this lab, we'll explore the protocol to see exactly what's going on between the browser and the web server. We'll cover: HTTP basics HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) HTTPS Troubleshooting tools Proxies Caching HTTP/2 We'll investigate how we can take advantage of HTTP features to troubleshoot problems, and to improve the performance of our Rails apps.

    The need to keep your personal information, sensitive or nonsensitive, secure from prying eyes isn't new, but recent events have brought it back into the public eye. In this workshop, we'll build and upload public keys, explore Git commit signing, and learn to sign others' PGP keys. If we have time, we'll exchange key fingerprints and show IDs, then discuss signing and verifying gems. You'll need a photo ID and your own computer for this workshop.

    Managing your infrastructure with configuration management tools like Chef melds the practices of development and operations together. This workshop will focus on a development practice - Test Driven Development - and how that method can be applied to managing your Rails infrastructure and deployments. You will learn how to: Analyze your application and define your infrastructure needs (databases, load balancers, etc.), define unique infrastructure requirements for Rails applications (i.e. asset pipeline), capture your requirements in tests using Test Kitchen, ServerSpec, and other frameworks

    Capybara has allowed us to build complex and ambitious applications with the confidence that everything comes together in the user experience we're targeting. As the capabilities of the web have grown, interactions and behavior in our applications have become more complex and harder to test. Our tests become coupled to CSS selectors, fail intermittently, take longer and our confidence dwindles. In this talk, I'll go over best practices for working with a large Capybara test suite and dig into APIs and options we can use to handle complex apps such as a chat app not written in Ruby.

    We will talk about introspection features of Ruby interpreter (MRI) to solve troubles on your Ruby on Rails application. Rails application development with Ruby is basically fast and easy. However, when you have trouble such as tough bugs in your app, performance issues and memory consumption issues, they are difficult to solve without tooling. In this presentation, I will show you what kind of introspection features MRI has and how to use them with your Rails application.

    Performance regressions in edge Rails versions happen quite often, and are sometimes introduced even by experienced Core commiters. The Rails team doesn’t have any tools to get notified about this kind of regressions yet. This is why I’ve built RailsPerf, a regression detection tool for Rails. It resembles a continuous integration service in a way: it runs benchmarks after every commit in Rails repo to detect any performance regressions. I will speak about building a right set of benchmarks, isolating build environments, and I will also analyze some performance graphs for major Rails versions

    RSpec is often described with the word “magic” by both its users and its detractors.

    Understanding how RSpec matchers, doubles, and specifications work will help you as an RSpec user. You will be able to take advantage of RSpec’s flexibility to make your tests clearer and more expressive. You’ll also get some exposure to new RSpec features, like compound matchers.

    Walking through a typical RSpec example, we’ll show the RSpec internals as RSpec evaluates matchers and uses doubles. You’ll leave with a better understanding of how to harness RSpec in your own tests.

The experts in this session have analyzed thousands of interviews and will share how to create a great candidate experience in your company and how to scale your teams effectively. Candidates can use these same lessons to prepare for interviews and evaluate the companies interviewing them.

    Rails apps start out quickly and beautifully, but after a year features are a struggle, tests are slow, developers are grinding, and stakeholders are unhappy. "Skinny controllers and fat models" hasn't worked, and "use service objects!" is awfully vague.

    This talk explains how to compact the "big ball of mud" at the heart of your app into a bedrock of reliable code. It gives the steps to incrementally refactor models into a functional core and gives explicit rules for how to write light, reliable tests.

But this philosophy is rarely extended to the code we write. We'll take a look at some principles of UX and Interface Design and relate them back to our code. By comparing code that gets it right to code that gets it desperately wrong, we'll learn some principles that we can use to write better, more usable code.

    Code reviews are not about catching bugs. Modern code reviews are about socialization, learning, and teaching.

    How can you get the most out of a peer's code review and how can you review code without being seen as overly critical? Reviewing code and writing easily-reviewed features are skills that will make you a better developer and a better teammate.

    You will leave this talk with the tools to implement a successful code-review culture. You'll learn how to get more from the reviews you're already getting and how to have more impact with the reviews you leave.

    There's a problem with this story: We are humans, developing software with humans, to benefit humans. And humans are messy.

    We wrap ourselves in process, trying to trade people for personas, points, planning poker, and the promise of predictability. Only people aren't objects to be abstracted away. Let's take some time to think through the trade offs we're making together.

    Fostering diversity is a commonly cited goals for the tech community, and - let's be honest - the liberal arts are kicking our butts at it. This was not always the case, though; until very recently, the faces of the liberal arts were exclusively white and male. This changed thanks to distinct strategies and deliberate cultural shifts brought about in the late 20th century, some of which the tech community has copied and others we can use more effectively. In this talk, we will explore some of those strategies by examining the education, history, and culture of the liberal arts.

    Like most programmers I am lazy. I don't want to do something by hand if I can automate it. I also think DevOps can be dreadfully dull. Luckily there are now tools that support lazy DevOps. I'll demonstrate how using Docker containers and Kubernetes allows you to be lazy and get back to building cool features (or watching cat videos). I'll go over some of the pros and cons to the "lazy" way and I'll show how these tools can be used by both simple and complex apps.

    Like an espresso, code is better served in small portions. Unfortunately most of the time we build systems consisting of a monolithic application that gets bigger and scarier by the day. Fortunately there are a few ways to solve this problem.

    Everyone talks about how good microservices are. At a first glance an architecture of small independently deployable services seems ideal, but it's no free lunch, it comes with some drawbacks.

    In this talk we'll see how microservices help us think differently about writing code and solving problems, and why they are not always the right answer.

Once you learn how to build your own SVG graphics then it's possible to do cool things like cache them, or use your own CSS and JavaScript to manipulate them. This presentation will show you how.

    Contributing to Rails for the first time can be terrifying. In this lab I’ll make contributing to Rails more approachable by going over the contributing guidelines and technical details you need to know. We’ll walk through traversing the source code with tools such as CTags, source_location and TracePoint. Additionally, we’ll create reproduction scripts for reporting issues and learn advanced git commands like bisect and squash. At the end of this session you’ll have the confidence to fix bugs and add features to Ruby on Rails

    Working with large CSS codebases can be hard. Large-scale refactors, or even just tweaking styles on our more general elements, could end up having unintended consequences on the rest of the site. To catch these problems, we manually check every page on our site, which is a slow and error-prone approach. We need a better way to test our CSS. This talk will walk through how we implemented a visual CSS testing framework using RSpec & Selenium, using automatic screenshot comparison to catch style regressions.

    When we want to offer customizability to the users of our applications, things can get tricky. How do we allow users to customize the look of the user interface while reusing the static CSS we’ve already designed?

    There is a way, but it is fraught with many dangers. Learn about the power of dynamically generating CSS from Sass files. Tackle the foes of dynamic content injection, rendering, caching, and background processing. In the end, we will look triumphantly at our ability to reuse our application styles to create customizable interfaces for our end users.

    While most parts of Rails have been thoroughly overhauled during the past few years, one part has stubbornly refused improvement. The view layer is still by default using ERB to transform your app’s objects into HTML. While trying to solve a seemingly unrelated problem we discovered a design that suddenly enabled us to move past the limitations of ERB while still integrating closely with Rails. We could now separate presentation logic from display structure; reason about our views and how they relate; and dramatically improve our code. We called the library Curly, and it's pretty awesome.

    We talk about bringing new developers "up to speed quickly." Imposter syndrome is bad enough, but often junior developers feel pressured to learn faster and produce more. Developers often focus on velocity as the critical measure of success. The need for speed actually amplifies insecurities, magnifies imposter syndrome, and hinders growth. Instead let's talk about how we can track and plan progress using meaningful goals and metrics.

    Rails and the ActiveRecord gem are really handy tools to get work done, and do it quickly. They aren't a silver bullet, though.

It will cover idiosyncrasies of how time zones are handled in Ruby and Rails, how to write tests to avoid false positives, and advice on how to release time zone-related code changes more safely.

    In Rails 5, the old way of returning false to implicitly halt a callback chain will not work anymore.

    This change will impact any codebase using ActiveSupport, ActiveRecord, ActiveModel or ActiveJob.

    Methods like before_action, before_save, before_validation will require developers to explicitly throw an exception in order the halt the chain.

    This talk will explain the motivations behind the new default, will delve into the internals of Rails to show the actual code, and will help developers and gem maintainers safely upgrade their apps to Rails 5.

    With projects like Doorkeeper, OAuth has pretty solid support in Rails when dealing with one application. However, when Rails applications get larger, many project teams break up their monolithic application into services. Some suggest installing Doorkeeper on every service, whereas others recommend routing all traffic through a single service.

    Recently, we worked on a project where neither of these solutions seemed right. Join us as we talk about our experience in federating OAuth in order to handle over 30,000 concurrent users.

    Ruby is a productive language that developers love. When Ruby isn't fast enough, they often fall back to writing C extensions. But C extensions are scary for a number of reasons; it's easy to leak memory, or segfault the entire process. When we started to look at writing parts of the Skylight agent using native code, Rust was still pretty new, but its promise of low-level control with high-level safety intrigued us. We'll cover the reasons we went with Rust, how we structured our code, and how you can do it too. If you're looking to expand your horizons, Rust may be the language for you.

PostgreSQL JSON column and ActiveRecord::Store to the rescue! This talk covers a way to wrap these Rails 4 features to simplify the building of extensive hierarchical data models. You will learn to expressively declare schema-less attributes on your model that act much like “real" columns, meaning they are typecast, validated, query able, embeddable, and behave with Rails form builders.

    Developers are trained to communicate to things with a goal in mind. When you're talking to something like, say a computer, you type in your code and it responds by giving you back what you want. Simple and straight-forward. Talking to humans? That's more of a challenge. Why? Because communicating with people requires a special set of skills - namely, empathy and a little bit of storytelling. In an industry filled with brilliant minds, great ideas and mass disruption, so few of the best and brightest know how to tell their compelling story. This workshop will teach you how.

We're going to look at the process of designing a new API for attributes and type casting in Rails 5.0, and why simpler is better. We'll unravel some of the mysteries behind the internals of Active Record. After all, Rails is ultimately just a large legacy code base. In this talk you'll learn about the process of finding those simple APIs which are begging to be extracted, and the refactoring process that can be used to tease them out slowly.

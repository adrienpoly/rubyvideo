    Nil is pretty simple — it represents nothing. But that doesn't mean that it's always easy to use, or that it's always the right choice when it appears to be the obvious choice.

    We'll cover several anti-patterns in the use of nil. We'll discuss *why* they're problematic, and explore some better alternatives. The refactorings that we'll look at will help to reduce errors and optimize for understanding. Writing good code might take a little longer in the short run, but it pays off in the long run.

    My Rails App is Old Enough to Drink: Over Two Decades with One App by John Paul Ashenfelter

    I've been running the same Rails app for two decades. I want to share some history about why Rails was a good choice then (and now!), cover what has changed and what's remained the same over the years, and look ahead to what's in store as one developer and one app start our third decade together.

What's a Rubyist to do? While I don't have any guarantees, I do have a couple ideas.

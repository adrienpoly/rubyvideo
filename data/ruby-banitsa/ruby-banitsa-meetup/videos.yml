    With Rails 8 out, Kamal is all the rage about deployment. But can we go even simpler? And by simpler, we mean roll it out all yourself because you know, you may know what you are doing, and competence is indeed bliss! Welcome Evgeni, who will present gobot, a custom deployment tool with automatic self-update, notification, and all the bells and whistles an organization needs.

    Balkan Ruby was a great success! I had a blast and I hope you did as well. While running the event, I built a website, ticketing, and an invoicing system from scratch. Are those systems important for running the event? Absolutely not! However, I am a coder, and code I did.

    It was worth it as those systems let us run a smooth registration at the event, do ticket discounts, one-off sales, issue refunds, and freed us from doing error-prone manual invoicing. Let me show you them codes!

    Code is not essential for running events, even tech events but I'm a coder, and code I did. It helped!

    For this event we are hosted by Questers. We'll be in their terrace, or QTerrace, rain or shine.

    Hristo Vladev is following up his May "Intro to Hotwire" talk with a practical "Hotwire at Work" session. This won't be a talk, but a live code-along.

    Hotwire is an alternative approach to building modern web applications without using much JavaScript by sending HTML instead of JSON over the wire. It's an alternative to the single-page application frameworks like React.

    We are testing a new venue for our May event. Resonator, a place to collaborate, co-create, experiment & share knowledge & expertise. It's close to Pette Kyosheta.

    Are you riding the the React Server Components (RSC) hype train? Did you know that you can avoid the whole hydration/de-hydration approach if you leverage plain old HTML? Hotwire is an alternative approach to building modern web applications without using much JavaScript by sending HTML instead of JSON over the wire.

    Some people like it, some even use it, but we are just gonna talk about it. Welcome Hristo Vladev with his Intro to Hotwire to Ruby Banitsa!

    Happy new year! We are starting 2023 with something different. Our January 2023 event won't have a talk but will be a discussion, lead by Gabriela Luhova about "Process organization".

    We, and I mean all of us, will talk about the processes we use to deliver our (non) Ruby projects because "good code", whatever your definition for good is, is not enough. How do we structure our workload? Do we use sprints? Do you work on a product or for a client? How do you communicate with clients? And all the evergreen questions!

    Come and discourse with us in Barter Community Hub on the 25th of January from 18:30. We won't be streaming this one. While at it, make sure to convince me that chat channel and a Kanban board with a single "Done" column is not enough!

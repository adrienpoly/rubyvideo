    We’ll explore the Erlang Virtual Machine, a unique runtime designed for building highly concurrent and fault-tolerant systems. Built on the principles of the actor model, the Erlang VM handles processes and messaging in a way that has inspired scalable and resilient software for decades. Together, we’ll take a closer look at how it works and why its design continues to power some of the world's most demanding systems. Let’s dive in!

    In this talk, we'll do a walkthrough of two gems of mine, ActiveRecord::AssociatedObject and Oaken.

    I'll go over why I wrote them and we'll break down the code too.

    The talk will you give you practical insight into what smaller gems look like, and hopefully inspire you to write your own!

    Bozhidar is the author of RuboCop and the editor of the community Ruby
    style guide. He's involved in a myriad of open-source projects, mainly
    related to Ruby, Clojure, and Emacs. Many would probably describe
    him as an Emacs zealot (and they would be right).

    This talk is very strange and unusual, unexpected, or not natural. It's a talk about Ruby!

    Hello there, Fellow Ruby Engineers!

    In continuation of our tradition, we would like to invite you to our special edition of Barcelona.rb!
    We will be gathering at the bar, having beers in an amazing company of fellow ruby engineers! There will be no official talks, no speakers, formal agenda and budget (meaning that everyone pays for their own beer üòÖ), just a company of friendly engineers, willing to chat, joke, laugh and discuss the latest news of the Ruby community!

    ‚è∞ 18:30
    üìç la textil collective / 303 audiophile bar, Carrer de Casp, 33B, Barcelona

    on the verge of switching industry when she gets a call from an anxious young man.
    \"Some class methods have gone missing,\" he tells her breathlessly. \"I need your
    help.\"\r\n\r\nDeirdre takes the case and begins exploring Ruby objects behind the
    scenes. Though she thinks she's on familiar ground — Ruby's object model, method
    lookup — she's about to discover that she really has no clue.\r\n\r\n[Nadia](http://www.nadiaodunayo.com/)

    Heidi Waterhouse
    (Fixed video)

    Come listen to me talk about my own invisible neurodiversity, and what it has taught me about being a good employee and becoming more effective because of who I am, not in spite of it.

    Heidi is a developer advocate with LaunchDarkly. She delights in working at the intersection of usability, risk reduction, and cutting-edge technology. One of her favorite hobbies is talking to developers about things they already knew but had never thought of that way before. She sews all her conference dresses so that she’s sure there is a pocket for the mic.

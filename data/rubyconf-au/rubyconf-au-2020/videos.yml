    us is making calls to an API, uploading images, and streaming the latest content.
    But what is the cost of this—is it free? This talk explores the reality of data,

    importance of performance testing as new features and products, marketing campaigns,
    and annual events such as the festival could all cause spikes in traffic to any
    site. To find your application’s bottleneck, come and enjoy a talk of how to build
    a performance testing framework with Ruby . Through this talk Nancy will take
    you through what are the correct questions to ask before designing your testing
    strategy. Then you will learn how Airtasker selected the testing tools and what
    our testing strategies are. This is a topic for anyone interested in doing performance
    testing for both web and API\r\n\r\nI learnt Economics and Interpreting and Translation
    in Uni. But after I graduated I ended up being a dental nurse for 2.5 years. Then
    I realised I need a career that has bright future so I started to learn software
    testing. I taught myself the necessary coding skills to became a QA engineer.
    Later under the mentorship of the other software engineers at Airtasker I became
    one of them as well. I love Lord of the Rings to death! For me it's the best movie

    of code quality and then focus on one which will be composed of three sections:Code
    Coverage: How well covered is my application? Complexity: How complex are the
    methods in my application? Code Smells: Are there any known code smells in my
    application? Code CoverageI will talk about SimpleCov and how we would use it
    to calculate test coverage for our applications.ComplexityI will talk about flog
    and how we would use it to calculate a complexity score for our application. Combined
    with the previous section, we will be able to calculate the relative complexity
    (super complex methods are so much worse with 0% testcoverage). Ernesto will briefly
    explain Flog’s ABC metric (Assignments, Branches, Calls) Code Smells. He will
    also talk about reek and how we would use it to find code smells in a sample Roda
    application. After going over these three sections, he will talk about a new tool

    have different accessibility needs. But when you’re working in other industries,
    it’s often much less true that what “works” for you as a programmer will also

    feel safe throwing around ideas, teams that look out for each other, teams where
    the needs of the individuals in the team are (mostly) met, teams that can learn
    and grow with your company. Nurturing environments in which such teams can form
    and flourish is an endlessly challenging and rewarding task that belongs to everyone
    in the company. And yet, a lot of the work to identify issues, champion change
    and improve a company’s culture and the diversity of its workforce is done by
    the same few people, or left entirely to HR. These folks could do with a hand.
    A hand from you! This talk will lay out (some) of the work that’s already being
    done, provides a handy how-to guide to getting started in diversity and inclusion
    and extends an invitation to anyone who cares about the issue to lend a hand.\r\n\r\nAdel
    Smee is an Engineering Manager at Zendesk where, for the last four years, she
    has led innovation projects across a variety of technologies and grown a number
    of high performing teams. Her career in tech started with teaching people to code,
    before she decided to break out and get paid to do it commercially at a startup,
    then at Lonely Planet, and then at Zendesk. Along the way she realised that her
    main implicit motivator is delight in the success of others, which turns out to
    be a really useful quality in a manager. She is obsessed with what makes people
    (and herself) tick and loves to hear how she is getting it wrong so she can do
    better. Adel is an incurable optimist who believes that one day we’ll live in
    a world where everybody likes their job as much as she does, but isn’t naive enough
    to think that day is coming any time soon.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#ruby

    "Dana Sherson\n\nRuby sometimes has a reputation for being slow, but
    it doesn't have to be. There are likely ways to optimise fragments of your application
    and not even have to rewrite it in rust. Improve your intuition about bottlenecks
    and optimisations and how to use and read the output of tools like ruby-prof,
    rb-spy, benchmark, and others (including Dana's favourite: time), how to know
    what needs attention, and some surprising quirks when writing fast ruby. The title
    may seem like an exaggeration, but Dana did make a spell-checking ruby gem at
    least 300 times faster with the liberal application of benchmarking and profiling,
    and you can too.\r\n\r\nDana has been programming in ruby for at least 10 years,
    and her ruby tattoo may prove she might like it a little too much. When not programming
    in ruby, Dana can be found failing at being a photographer, singing Avril Lavigne
    songs at karaoke, or adding unnecessary emoji to slack :yoda:. Dana has killed
    every plant that was ever in her care.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#ruby

    "Xavier Shay\n\nBecoming a senior contributor to your organization
    takes years. It's a process that is stubbornly hard to accelerate - it takes much
    more than drilling code katas!\r\n\r\nIn this talk Xavier reflect on situations
    he's encountered over the last decade, and apply some academic models he's found
    useful to explain and learn from them. By doing so we can better understand the
    limits to learning and prepare ourselves to make the most out of our experience.\r\n\r\nXavier
    recently moved back home to Melbourne after spending eight years in San Francisco,
    mostly as an engineering leader at Square. Currently working at Ferocia building

    to Australia.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#ruby

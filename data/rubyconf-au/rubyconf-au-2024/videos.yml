    Ruby has many standard libraries since Ruby 1.8. We are developing them with GitHub today using default and bundled gems mechanism. I plan to continue this process for Ruby 3.4 and future versions.

    However, some versions may encounter `LoadError` at `require` when running `bundle exec` or `bin/rails`, for example with `matrix` or `net-smtp`. We need to understand how they differ from standard libraries.

    In this presentation, I will explain how Ruby's `require` and `bundle exec` work with default/bundled gems. I will also suggest what users can do to load them successfully.

    This presentation covers scaling Ruby applications using lessons learned over eight years. First, it touches on the importance of managing on-call duties, such as addressing incidents, fixing errors, and performing updates. The talk then moves to the topic of team structure, detailing roles such as domain lead and architect, and ways to split larger groups into smaller, agile teams.

    The presentation also covers application updates, discussing methods like soft updates, force updates, and feature toggles. A focus on secure data management includes best practices for data encryption and protecting customer's data.

    The importance of clear, understandable documentation will also be discussed, along with strategies for fostering a testing culture in development teams and applying UML schemas before starting development.

    Optimising the developer experience is essential for productivity - so the presentation explores ways to collect and implement developers' ideas. Finally, it explains how to use modern technologies to speed up releases, track success metrics, perform regular stress testing, and ensure ongoing security.

    This presentation aims to help you navigate the complexities of scaling Ruby applications, saving both time and resources in your operations.

    Culture is complex. Startups grow. So how do we build an effective organisation that gets shit done, and the people doing the work love what they do and where they work. We know a secret! It came from a clown, and is backed up by the science. It’s a word we have lost the true meaning of.. it’s play. Come and listen to how a head of people and a clown helped co-create a company culture grounded in play that navigated the waters of remote working, global expansion and high growth… while the world was going through some things. This talk is going to be weird, fun and above all super useful.

    In an era where most activities in life can be executed online, the majority of countries still lack the ability to interact politically via the internet, such as online voting, party membership registration, and petition signing.

    In Taiwan, a political party named “New Power Party” has, since its establishment in 2015, relied on volunteers to develop a complete system enabling online party membership, donations, and voting. After several years of developing and operating in a dynamic and evolving manner, the system accumulated substantial technical debt. This led to issues with proper and complete system functionality and maintenance, impacting the party’s operations. Eventually, we decided to re-evaluate the specifications and rebuild the entire system using the latest versions of Ruby and Rails.

    In this session, I will explore the process of revamping an outdated Rails application, lacking in testing and specification documentation, with the new Ruby 3 and Rails 7. This will include code refactoring, selecting the Runtime Stack, and integrating automated deployment processes using Ruby-based tools. I will also share practical experiences and reflections on integrating data from old and new versions and relaunching the system.

    We're rebuilding Culture Amp's second largest product - Performance. It's 9 years old, came in as a Series A acquisition 5 years ago, has over 2700 customers with the largest one at 77k users. Against conventional wisdom, we're rebuilding it from the ground up with an aggressive timeline. The underlying model is outdated, slow to iterate on, and not extensible. The monoliths are riddled with tech debt, tightly coupled, patched and band-aided over many times, and won't scale to the $3b global Performance market we're targeting.

    That wasn't challenging enough already I'm also using this opportunity to rebuild our engineering culture. Setting a high bar for engineering standards, ways of working, and hoping to improve engagement as we go.

    Implementing a feature like "notifications" in an app sounds simple, right? As you dig in to problems like this, you'll realize the complexity that lies below the surface.

    In this talk, we'll walk through designing a feature like Notifications and how naming, DSLs, metaprogramming, and a bunch of other small decisions can make code feel delightful to use. Plus, we'll take a look at some of the decisions along the way that didn't turn out so well, analyze why they didn't work, and how we can improve them.

    Remember Ryan's inspiring talk in 2018 about the magic of hiring junior developers? It definitely struck a chord with me, leading me to bring numerous juniors on board since then. Their fresh perspectives have been game-changers, sparking innovation and enriching our team's dynamics and skillset.

    In my talk, I’ll dive into the ‘how-tos’ of finding and integrating these rising stars into your team, especially in a remote setting. We'll explore effective mentoring strategies, and I’ll share my playbook on crafting an onboarding process that truly resonates. You’ll learn the art of teaching vital skills that transform juniors into invaluable team players.

    We'll talk about creating a nurturing space where regular feedback and one-on-one sessions are the norm. I'll guide you through the balancing act of challenging your juniors - hitting that sweet spot where it's neither overwhelming nor underwhelming. It's about finding the right rhythm that fosters growth.

    And here’s a twist: this journey isn’t just about the juniors. It’s a fantastic opportunity for your senior members to level up as well, evolving into mentors and leaders. My talk isn’t just a guide; it's a story of growth, learning, and collective success. Let’s explore how junior developers can be your team’s next great asset.

    When you provide a block to a function in Ruby, do you know when and where that block will be executed? What is safe to do inside a block, and what is dangerous? What is a block, after all? Blocks in Ruby are everywhere, and we’re so used to them that we may even be ignorant of all their power and complexity. Let’s take a look at various code examples and understand what dragons are hidden in Ruby dungeons.

    Ruby programmers usually don't need to think much about blocks… until they have to. As a contributor to Ruby gems that have callback-based API for developers, I've found that internal implementation details of these gems affects how these callbacks are executed and resulting behavior can be quite surprising sometimes, and I think that good Ruby developer should know inner workings of blocks to better understand execution flow of complex Ruby programs.

    Macuject is an Australian digital health startup helping prevent blindness by supporting eye care professionals in achieving the best possible outcomes for their patients with diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
    Our presentation will give an overview of the eye's structure, straightforward steps to ensure the health of your eyes, AMD, its treatment, and how our software helps make individualised decisions. It is sure to be a real eye-opener!

    After that, we’ll switch lenses to discuss our technology stack, primarily focusing on our Majestic Monolith powered by Rails 7! As a MedTech startup, the experience doctors have when interacting with our app can have a considerable impact. Over the past year, we've improved that experience dramatically through using Hotwire. We’ll share how our small team is gradually replacing our React frontend with Hotwire while rapidly building eye-popping new features.

    With Turbo Frames, Turbo Streams, and Stimulus, Hotwire lets us rethink when to use JavaScript and allows us to use just the amount we need, where we need it. It allows us the flexibility we want, with all the functionality we need, in a Rails-friendly paradigm that's a delight to work with.

    When a single Redis instance is not enough, Redis offers a number of different options for scaling out to multiple nodes, with different tradeoffs for read/write throughput and availability. At Zendesk, we have migrated to Redis cluster mode for one of our write-heavy workloads.

    We found, however, that simply flipping the switch to turn on cluster mode did not quite work as we'd hoped! This talk will cover our journey of getting Redis Cluster to work properly with our Ruby monolith; in particular:

    * How Redis cluster mode works, and what it requires of language-specific client libraries, and
    * How we added support for missing features we needed into the redis-cluster-client gem

    Redis Cluster should now be a solid choice for your Ruby applications as well!

    Ruby on Rails is growing! As a Rails company grows, the application too becomes larger as more engineers work on it at the same time. There is an increasing need for companies to build out a "Rails Infrastructure" team. The team’s primary goal is to ensure the long-term success of the application and its engineers. But how?

    Let’s talk about the responsibilities and philosophy behind such a team. These learnings are from working on a team that supports 400+ engineers at one of the largest Rails applications. You’ll get some insight on what our team does in order to ensure a Rails application scales with its growth. Spoiler: There’s more to just enforcing Rubocop rules!

    "Vienna.rb is back! Are you interested in the Ruby language or Ruby on Rails? Join
    us. We have great talks, good vibes, and cookies! \U0001F36A\n\nTalks\n~~~~~\n\n\U0001F5E3️
    Grzegorz Jakubiak\n▶️ Refine Your Monkey Patch\n\U0001F5D2️ A practical guide to
    monkey patching without introducing unexpected bugs. Learn techniques to safely
    extend your code without unwanted side effects, using Ruby’s refinement feature—a
    tool Matz has labeled a failure. This talk will equip you with best practices for
    patching responsibly.\n\n\U0001F5E3️ Thomas Leitner\n▶️ 10 Years of HexaPDF\n\U0001F5D2️
    A look at how HexaPDF came to be, from idea to running a business. The journey was
    (and still is) filled with challenges, happy moments and things one should -in hindsight
    - definitely not do! \U0001F642 The talk is light on the technical side of HexaPDF
    and focuses more on the things I did and learned.\n\n\U0001F5E3️ Nicolas Dular\n▶️
    An Epic Migration\n\U0001F5D2️ Join me on our epic adventure of migrating GitLab
    epics! In this talk, I'll dive into the challenges of executing zero-downtime migrations
    at scale, why we opted for bi-directional syncing (and the struggles that came with
    it), and how we coordinated the project. Come for the tech insights, and stay for
    the stories of how we tracked down out-of-sync data!\n\nInterested in delivering
    a talk? Let us know!\n\nLocation\n~~~~~~~~\n\nMariahilfer Str. 97/4,\n1060 Wien\n\nSponsors\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n⭐
    Meister\n\nFounded in 2006 by Till Vollmer and Michael Hollauf, Meister’s journey
    from start-up to scale-up has been a story of continual growth. What started with
    a vision to create a simple visual mind-mapping tool has become not one but two
    collaborative tools that help teams everywhere focus on the work that matters.\n\nThank
    you to Meister for hosting and providing us with refreshments and snacks! \U0001F64C\n\n⭐

    "It's the Vienna.rb spring edition! \U0001F338 Are you interested in the Ruby language
    or Ruby on Rails? Join us. We have great talks, good vibes, and yummy snacks! \U0001F60B\n\nWe
    have something special this time: Lightning Talks! ⚡\n\nLightning talks are limited
    to 10 minutes and are an excellent opportunity for first-time speakers to try their
    hand at public speaking. Check it out!\n\nTalks & Lightning Talks\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\U0001F5E3️
    Jan Grodowski\n▶️ Balancing Quality and Speed of Testing with the Undercover Gem\n\U0001F5D2️
    We'll take a look at Ruby test coverage strategies and the variables that come into
    play when preventing faults in our software products. We'll discuss what makes tests
    good, what to test versus not to and when is the right time to do it. I'll introduce
    the undercover Ruby gem and additionally share a few stories about turning this
    idea and gem into a side hustle.\n\n⚡ Seth Horsley\n▶️ Building Beautiful UIs with
    ruby: A Rails-native Approach\n\U0001F5D2️ Tired of slow ERB templates and messy
    view logic? Discover how Phlex and RubyUI bring blazing-fast (12x!) and beautiful
    components to Rails while maintaining the Ruby way we all love. Let's see how we
    can build modern, accessible UIs without leaving the Rails ecosystem!\n\n⚡ Anton
    Bangratz\n▶️ Jujutsu: Will it replace Git?\n\U0001F5D2️ Jujutsu is a DVCS, or \"distributed
    version control system\". You are probably familiar with the biggest of those systems:
    Git. Jujutsiy is said to be easier and simpler than Git while being even more powerful.
    In this talk we'll find out if that's true!\n\n⚡ Johannes Daxböck\n▶️ Logical, Mr

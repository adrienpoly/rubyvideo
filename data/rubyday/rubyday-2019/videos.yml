    "For several years now Rubyists around the world have been fascinated
    by the plans for the next big Ruby release - namely Ruby 3.0. While a lot has
    been said about 3.0, there’s also a lot of confusion about it - the scope, the
    timeline, backwards compatibility, etc. This talk is an attempt to summarize everything
    that’s currently known about Ruby 3.0 and present it into an easily digestible
    format. We’ll go over all the main features targeting Ruby 3.0 and many of the
    open questions surrounding them.\n\nrubyday Verona 2019 - April 11th https://2019.rubyday.it/\n\nNext

    "With more applications now using service-oriented architectures, developers
    must know how to talk to distributed technologies and to handle errors and failures.
    While you can usually depend on libraries to encapsulate such details, it's important
    to understand and to be able to predict the behavior of your distributed systems.
    This talk will arm you with algorithms and testing strategies so you can tame
    your services and build robust applications.\n\nrubyday Verona 2019 - April 11th

    "JS is often a struggle for the Ruby developer used to live in the
    backend. We'll have a fresh look at the language implementing interfaces for a
    Tetris-like game for the terminal (using MRI) and for the browser (using Opal)
    using different techniques (vanilla JS, jQuery, Vue.js). The whole thing will
    be preceded by an introduction to Opal.\n\nrubyday Verona 2019 - April 11th https://2019.rubyday.it/\n\nNext

    "Many Ruby programmers are looking for new opportunities now that serverless
    is becoming more popular. Hasura offers instant realtime GraphQL on Postgres as
    a serverless backend option. And the best part: you can still use Ruby to write
    the business logic for the backend! Using a sample application, I will show you
    how to build fast web applications with a Vue frontend and a backend running on
    Hasura’s GraphQL engine. We will explore how the different components work together
    and how you can take full advantage of the combination of these technologies.\n\nrubyday

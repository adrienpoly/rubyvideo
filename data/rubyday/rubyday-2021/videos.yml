    2021\n\nRuby 2.7 introduced Pattern Matching, but what can you use it for? How
    about we play a few hands of poker to find out. This talk explores Pattern Matching
    patterns through scoring poker hands using named captures, pins, hash destructuring,
    array destructuring, and more. If you've been waiting for some practical examples
    of Pattern Matching this is your talk.\n\n\nThe ninth edition of the Italian Ruby

    the release of 6.1, Rails added support for rendering objects that respond to
    'render_in', a feature extracted from the GitHub application. This change enabled
    the development of ViewComponent, a framework for building reusable, testable
    & encapsulated view components. In this talk, we’ll share what we’ve learned scaling
    to hundreds of ViewComponents in our application, open sourcing a library of ViewComponents,
    and nurturing a thriving community around the project, both internally and externally.\n\nThe

    "API Optimization Tale: Monitor, Fix and Deploy (on Friday) - Maciek
    Rząsa - rubyday 2021\n\nI saw a green build on a Friday afternoon. I knew I need
    to push it to production before the weekend. My gut told me it was a trap. I had
    already stayed late to revert a broken deploy. I knew the risk. In the middle
    of a service extraction project, we decided to migrate from REST to GraphQL and
    optimize API usage. My deploy was a part of this radical change. Why was I deploying
    so late? How did we measure the migration effects? And why was I testing on production?
    I'll tell you a tale of small steps, monitoring, and old tricks in a new setting.
    Hope, despair, and broken production included.\n\nThe ninth edition of the Italian

    3 and beyond! In this talk we'll explore how types work in Ruby with the future
    of type checking in mind to deepen our understanding of the value of the new type

    2021\n\nThe increased debate around ethical source threatens to divide the OSS
    community. In his book 'The Structure of Scientific Revolutions', philosopher
    Thomas Kuhn posits that there are three possible solutions to a crisis like the
    one we're facing: procrastination, assimilation, or revolution. Which will we
    choose as we prepare for the hard work of reconciling ethics and open source?\n\nThe

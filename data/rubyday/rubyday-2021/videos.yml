    Playing a Hand with Ruby Pattern Matching - Brandon Weaver - rubyday 2021

    Ruby 2.7 introduced Pattern Matching, but what can you use it for? How about we play a few hands of poker to find out. This talk explores Pattern Matching patterns through scoring poker hands using named captures, pins, hash destructuring, array destructuring, and more. If you've been waiting for some practical examples of Pattern Matching this is your talk.

    The ninth edition of the Italian Ruby conference, for the third time organised by GrUSP, took place online on April 7th 2021.

    ViewComponents in the Real World - Joel Hawksley - rubyday 2021

    With the release of 6.1, Rails added support for rendering objects that respond to 'render_in', a feature extracted from the GitHub application. This change enabled the development of ViewComponent, a framework for building reusable, testable & encapsulated view components. In this talk, we’ll share what we’ve learned scaling to hundreds of ViewComponents in our application, open sourcing a library of ViewComponents, and nurturing a thriving community around the project, both internally and externally.

    API Optimization Tale: Monitor, Fix and Deploy (on Friday) - Maciek Rząsa - rubyday 2021

    I saw a green build on a Friday afternoon. I knew I need to push it to production before the weekend. My gut told me it was a trap. I had already stayed late to revert a broken deploy. I knew the risk. In the middle of a service extraction project, we decided to migrate from REST to GraphQL and optimize API usage. My deploy was a part of this radical change. Why was I deploying so late? How did we measure the migration effects? And why was I testing on production? I'll tell you a tale of small steps, monitoring, and old tricks in a new setting. Hope, despair, and broken production included.

    The Rising Ethical Storm in Open Source - Coraline Ada Ehmke - rubyday 2021

    The increased debate around ethical source threatens to divide the OSS community. In his book 'The Structure of Scientific Revolutions', philosopher Thomas Kuhn posits that there are three possible solutions to a crisis like the one we're facing: procrastination, assimilation, or revolution. Which will we choose as we prepare for the hard work of reconciling ethics and open source?

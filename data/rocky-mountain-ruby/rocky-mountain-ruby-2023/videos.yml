    Rocky Mountain Ruby 2023 - The pursuit of happiness. by Dustin Haefele-Tschanz

    Who in this world would say ‘no’ to being a little happier? Luckily for us there has been a lot of wonderful scientific studies done on human happiness. This talk will cover a number of my favorite studies in this field, and how they can be applied to life and careers in tech.

    Rocky Mountain Ruby 2023 - Accessible by default by Joel Hawksley

    It’s one thing to build a new application that meets the latest accessibility standards, but it’s another thing to update an existing application to meet them. In this talk, we’ll share how we’re using automated accessibility scanning, preview-driven development, and an accessibility-first form builder to make GitHub’s 15-year-old, 1,400-controller Ruby on Rails monolith accessible.

    Rocky Mountain Ruby 2023 - Modularizing Rails Monoliths One Bite at a Time by Marc Reynolds

    As Rails monoliths grow, coupling becomes increasingly difficult to manage. Many have reached for hope in microservices but instead found higher complexity. The Modular Monolith approach is a proven, lightweight alternative that offers the benefits of enforced boundaries without being cumbersome. This talk proposes a phased approach to refactoring toward this style using the packwerk gem.

    Rocky Mountain Ruby 2023 - Go Pro with POROs by Ifat Ribon

    Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs) are having a moment. Maybe you’ve heard a whisper in the corner about the jack-of-all trades Service Object, or a glimmering echo of advocacy for non-database-backed domain models? Think you’re using them right? Afraid you’re using them wrong? Then this is the talk for you! We’re going to explore the wonderful world of “convention plus choose-your-own configuration” of Rails codebases and the shining role of POROs (with their ride or dies, the Module). Come hear about the diversity of design patterns out in the wild so you too can confidently tell your coworkers “let’s just use a PORO for that”.

    Rocky Mountain Ruby 2023 - Let’s Extract a Class: The Single Responsibility Principle and Design Patterns by Jon Evans

    We’ll talk about going beyond “fat model, skinny controller” and the importance of following the Single Responsibility Principle. Several common design patterns will be discussed, but the emphasis will be on the importance of encapsulating your logic in whatever way you choose that makes the code readable and maintainable. Finally, how do you get your team on board?

    Rocky Mountain Ruby 2023 - Caching strategies on https://dev.to by Ridhwana Khan

    We've always put a lot of effort into performance at Dev (https://dev.to/). We want our users to be able to see their content almost instantaneously when interacting with our site. In order to do so we've placed emphasis on caching. We've had to ask ourselves questions like what are the right things to cache? Which layer in the stack would be best to cache it? And how will this effect the overall performance? During this presentation, I'd like to show you some of the caching strategies we have in place and discuss how they've sped up the interactions within our site.

    Rocky Mountain Ruby 2023 - Licensing and Distributing a Paid CLI With Ruby, Rails, and SwiftUI by Moncef Belyamani

    Distributing licenses and enforcing limitations for my "Ruby on Mac" CLI was a super interesting and fun problem to solve. It involved tools such as ruby-packer, shc, Apple's DeviceCheck API, and creating a .pkg installer. I'll take you on that journey with me, with lessons learned and code samples. You'll learn tactics for thinking through similar problems, and for writing testable code.

    Rocky Mountain Ruby 2023 - A blueprint for making scary choices by Davy Stevenson

    In early 2021 I made the scariest decision of my life — I decided that I was going to stop waiting to find a partner and instead I would have a child by myself. My little boy is now 1 year old, and my life path looks completely different than I ever thought. We all are faced with overwhelming decisions in our lives. How do we know what choice is right for us? Through my own journey I've developed a rubric for evaluating these scary choices — whether professional or personal — and I hope that sharing these lessons might be helpful for you.

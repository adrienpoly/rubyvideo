    A Brewer's Guide to Filtering out Complexity and Churn by Alan Ridlehoover and Fito von Zastrow

    Mechanical coffee machines are amazing! You drop in a coin, listen for the clink, make a selection, and the machine springs to life, hissing, clicking, and whirring. Then the complex mechanical ballet ends, splashing that glorious, aromatic liquid into the cup. Ah! C’est magnifique! There’s just one problem. Our customers also want soup! And, our machine is not extensible. So, we have a choice: we can add to the complexity of our machine by jamming in a new dispenser with each new request; or, we can pause to make our machine more extensible before development slows to a halt.

    In this talk, I will dive into the ins and outs of Pry, the powerful runtime developer console for Ruby. Many developers know about Pry, but do they understand how it works under the hood? How does `binding.pry` halt code execution and inject itself into the process?

    We'll explore the mechanics of Pry, revealing how it integrates seamlessly with your code. Additionally, I'll share essential tips and tricks to maximize your productivity within Pry sessions, including:

    - Customizing your Pry environment
    - Navigating and debugging code efficiently
    - Utilizing advanced Pry features and plugins

    Whether you're a Pry novice or a seasoned user, this session will enhance your debugging and development skills, enabling you to harness Pry's full potential.

    Have you ever struggled to communicate a complex user experience to a diverse team of engineers, designers, or product managers? Static mockups and design tools can only take you so far.

    Join me to learn how you can use Bridgetown – the next-generation progressive site generator – as a rapid prototyping framework to solve these problems. I’ll show you how to harness Bridgetown’s Roda-powered server-side rendering capabilities to build fully functional prototypes that integrate with external APIs.

    Whether you're an engineer looking to communicate your ideas more effectively, a product manager seeking to validate complex flows, or simply curious about Bridgetown's capabilities beyond static sites, this talk will inspire you to leverage this powerful tool for your next project.

    Our industry is shockingly bad at accessibility: by some estimates, over 70% of websites are effectively unavailable to blind users! Making your app accessible isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s the law. In this talk, we’ll share what it’s taken to scale GitHub’s accessibility program and equip you to do the same at your company.

  description: |-
    We can write Ruby code in any number of styles, but the community has some accepted norms. For example, almost nobody uses `for` loops any more. We've decided that some styles are "better" than others. And we can keep finding "better" styles.

    In this talk, we'll dig into a more functional "lazy" style. Instead of setting up variables ahead of time, we'll call methods as needed. Instead of thinking about how to compute things, we'll think about properties of objects. This style has improved the readability of my code, and it will help you too.

  description: |-
    The evolution of developer experience (DX) tooling has been a game-changer in how we build, debug, and enhance web applications.

    This talk aims to illuminate the path toward enriching the Ruby on Rails ecosystem with advanced DX tools, focusing on the implementation of Language Server Protocols (LSP) for Stimulus and Turbo.

    Drawing inspiration from the rapid advancements in JavaScript tooling, we explore the horizon of possibilities for Rails developers, including how advanced browser extensions and tools specifically designed for the Hotwire ecosystem can level up your developer experience.

    Martians in 2021, our goal was to simplify real-time functionality for all Rails
    developers while making it commercially successful for our company. We aimed to
    build what people wanted and saw their priorities shift from GraphQL to Hotwire,
    from chats to collaboration, and to AI-powered voice apps. Initially focused on
    performance, we soon tackled WebSocket reliability and developer productivity,
    culminating in the launch of Managed AnyCable earlier this year. Our journey,
    fueled by consulting revenue, is not without valuable insights. Let’s reflect
    on our story, share our learnings, and glimpse into the future of AnyCable and
    real-time applications."

  description: |-
    The Coatue AI report is putting AI models at the centerpiece of all modern tech stacks going forward that Application Devs will be using to build on top of. It would not be controversial to say that the Ruby ecosystem lacks in its support and adoption of AI, ML and DS libraries. If we’d like to stay relevant in the future, we need to start building the foundations now. We’ll look at what Generative AI is, what kind of applications developers in other communities are building and how Ruby can be used to build similar applications today. We’ll cover Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), vector embeddings and semantic search, prompt engineering, and what the state of art (SOTA) in evaluating LLM output looks like today. We will also cover AI Agents, semi-autonomous general purpose LLM-backed applications, and what they’re capable of today. We'll make a case why Ruby is a great language to build these applications because of its strengths and its incredible ecosystem. After the slides, we'll build an AI Agent in 15 min.

  description: |-
    Been to a bootcamp but still trying to land that first real job? Perhaps you've landed an apprenticeship or entry-level job but anxious to move up?

    Or perhaps you lead a team and wish you knew how to acclimate junior developers seamlessly into your organization?

    This session is geared for you.

    Bootcamps can be helpful as a place to start, but there's always a gap between a bootcamp skillset and the skills required for a real job as a Ruby developer.

    In this talk, I'll lay out a practical guide to acquiring the skills and knowledge you'll need to get your foot into the industry or reach that next rung on your career ladder.

    I'll cover the areas of computer science most applicable to beginning Ruby programmers, highlight top programming skills that most bootcamps won't cover, and tactics for finding a position that suits you the best.

    I'll also cover the top three things every senior developer should keep in mind when hiring, training, and mentoring new developers.

    Along the way, we'll learn about this history of the Ruby community and tackle the most important skill of all: to learn how to learn more.

    Time-series data is remarkably common, with applications ranging from IoT to finance. Effectively storing, reading, and presenting this time-series data can be as finicky as catching the perfect wave.

    In order to understand the best-practices of time-series data, we’ll follow a surfer’s journey as she attempts to record every wave she’s ever caught. We’ll discover how to structure the time-series data, query for performant access, aggregate data over timespans, and present the data via an API endpoint. Surf’s up!

  description: |-
    Whiteboards. Proof of Concepts. Pairing. Spikes. These are all tools we use every day to have high-level technical conversations about ideas we propose or approaches we think are the “right” way. As someone advances in their career into more experienced levels of software engineering, however, a critical skill becomes how you conduct and lead these conversations. It involves clearly articulating a vision and securing buy-in, while also valuing and integrating the diverse perspectives and feedback from your peers. The goal beyond each individual conversation is to foster an environment where ideas can be exchanged, discussed, enhanced, and decided on. You’ll walk away from this talk with some new, innovative approaches to try out that not only help get your technical ideas across but also solicit additional thoughts and opinions in ways that engage and effectively address different points of view.

    Email is a powerful and flexible way to extend the capabilities of your Rails application. It’s a familiar and low friction way for users to interact with your app.

    As much as you may want your users to access your app, they may not need to. Email is a great example of focusing on the problem at hand instead of an over-complicated solution.

    We’ll take a deeper look at Action Mailbox and how to route and process your inbound emails.

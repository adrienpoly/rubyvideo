    "Strada is the missing library to take your Turbo Native apps to the
    next level. Turbo Native enables web developers to ship native apps, but the experience
    is limited to a WebView container within a native shell. The native app doesn’t
    have any knowledge about the web content that is being rendered, but Strada bridges
    that gap.\n \nAs part of the Hotwire family, Strada leverages the HTML you already
    have to enable high-fidelity native interactions on iOS and Android that are driven
    by your web app. 37signals Mobile Lead & Principal Programmer Jay Ohms walks us

    Teams everywhere are tired of scrum and curious about Shape Up. But very few of them are able to apply it by-the-book, because their companies are structured differently than 37signals, where Shape Up was created.

    That hasn’t reduced the demand, however. People understand that estimating story points and writing better tickets isn’t going to solve their problems. There are disconnects between the vision of what to do and what actually gets built. Building takes longer than expected and scope gets out of control. Programmers are treated like ticket-takers when what they really want is to see the whole problem and creatively solve it.

    Over the last couple years, Ryan Singer, author of ‘Shape Up’, has worked with a wider variety of companies with very different structures — teams with big gaps between junior and senior, where programmers far out-number designers, and where external pressures make six-week cycles out of the question. The result is new language, new techniques, and some broken rules, that will help you apply Shape Up in a way that’s custom-fit to your team.

    "More and more Rails applications adopt real-time features, and it’s
    not surprising - Action Cable and Hotwire brought development experience to the
    next level regarding dealing with WebSockets. You need zero knowledge of the underlying
    tech to start crafting a new masterpiece of web art. \n\nHowever, you will need
    this knowledge later to deal with ever-sophisticated feature requirements and

    with it efficiently and confidently.\n\nSlides available at: https://speakerdeck.com/palkan/railsworld-2023-untangling-cables-and-demystifying-twisted-transistors\n\nLinks:\nhttps://rubyonrails.org/\n\n#RailsWorld

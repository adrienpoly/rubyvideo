    In the Opening Keynote of the first Rails World, Ruby on Rails creator and @37signals CTO David Heinemeier Hansson (@davidheinemeierhansson9989) covered a lot of ground, including introducing 7 major tools: Propshaft, Turbo 8, Strada, Solid Cache, Solid Queue, Mission Control, and Kamal.

    Strada is the missing library to take your Turbo Native apps to the next level. Turbo Native enables web developers to ship native apps, but the experience is limited to a WebView container within a native shell. The native app doesn’t have any knowledge about the web content that is being rendered, but Strada bridges that gap.

    As part of the Hotwire family, Strada leverages the HTML you already have to enable high-fidelity native interactions on iOS and Android that are driven by your web app. 37signals Mobile Lead & Principal Programmer Jay Ohms walks us through it.

    A disk cache can hold much more data than a memory one. But is it fast enough?

    At @37signals they built Solid Cache, a database backed ActiveSupport cache, to test this out. Running in production on hey.com, they now cache months' rather than days' of data.

    The result: emails are 40% faster to display and it costs less to run.

    ‪@GitHub‬ encrypts your data at rest, as well as specific sensitive database columns. What you may not know is that they recently replaced their in-house db column encryption strategy with ActiveRecord::Encryption, in place. While they were able to complete this transition seamlessly for GitHub’s developers, the process was not quite seamless for our team and some of our customers, and mistakes were made along the way.

    Senior Product Security Engineer Kylie Stradley shares why despite the mistakes they feel the migration was worth it for their team, GitHub developers and most importantly, GitHub customers.

    Trilogy is a client library for MySQL-compatible database servers. It was open sourced along with an Active Record adapter by GitHub this past year. With promises of improved performance, better portability and compatibility, and fewer dependencies, Shopify’s Rails Infrastructure team decided to migrate our core Rails monolith from Mysql2 to Trilogy.

    @shopify Senior Software Developer Adrianna Chang explores why the Trilogy client was built and why Shopify wanted to adopt it.

    Telos Labs Software Engineer Alicia Rojas covers exciting stuff such as: caching and providing an offline fallback, how to make your app installable, and performing offline CRUD actions with IndexedDB and Hotwire.

    Note: Most code samples from this talk belong to a case study of an application conceived for rural people living in areas lacking stable internet access, such as farmers and agricultural technicians.

    Breno Gazzola, Co-Founder & CTO of FestaLab, discusses Propshaft, the heart of the new asset pipeline introduced in Rails 7.

    Rails 7 brought with it an overhauled asset pipeline that delivered a default “no-Node” approach to front end and improved support for modern bundlers like esbuild. This is great for developers as we are constantly searching for ways to make the development process more pleasant and to deliver better user experiences.

    However, the introduction of multiple gems that seem to have overlapping features has left many of you confused about how to take advantage of everything that Rails 7 has to offer.

    You want to make sure that when you create your next app, or update an existing one, you are making the correct choice and will not have to go back and redo a large part of your frontend. But to make that decision we have to understand what makes the new asset pipeline so different from the previous one.

    Teams everywhere are tired of scrum and curious about Shape Up. But very few of them are able to apply it by-the-book, because their companies are structured differently than 37signals, where Shape Up was created.

    That hasn’t reduced the demand, however. People understand that estimating story points and writing better tickets isn’t going to solve their problems. There are disconnects between the vision of what to do and what actually gets built. Building takes longer than expected and scope gets out of control. Programmers are treated like ticket-takers when what they really want is to see the whole problem and creatively solve it.

    Over the last couple years, Ryan Singer, author of ‘Shape Up’, has worked with a wider variety of companies with very different structures — teams with big gaps between junior and senior, where programmers far out-number designers, and where external pressures make six-week cycles out of the question. The result is new language, new techniques, and some broken rules, that will help you apply Shape Up in a way that’s custom-fit to your team.

    More and more Rails applications adopt real-time features, and it’s not surprising - Action Cable and Hotwire brought development experience to the next level regarding dealing with WebSockets. You need zero knowledge of the underlying tech to start crafting a new masterpiece of web art.

    However, you will need this knowledge later to deal with ever-sophisticated feature requirements and security and scalability concerns. @evil.martians Cable Engineer Vladimir Dementyev helps you understand Rails’ real-time component, Action Cable so you can work with it efficiently and confidently.

    Commercialized open source has effectively supported authors while also maintaining the benefits that open principles have on the industry. By obtaining an adequate share of the value we create, we’ll be able to work on industry-changing projects we’re passionate about for years to come.

    Yet, achieving success in this domain is not without its challenges. We must be willing to learn, experiment, and overcome obstacles along the way. In this talk, @evil.martians CEO Irina Nazarova will unveil her insights on navigating this journey, harnessing the power of Rails at every stage.

    Many conference talks have been created from engineers splitting services out of dusty old monolith apps. However, @Intercominc did the exact opposite - they moved multiple services back into their monolith and got huge productivity and reliability wins, allowing them to ship better features to their customers.

    Senior Principal Systems Engineer Brian Scanlan covers the reasons why these services existed in the first place, why they felt the need to move them into their monolith, whether the moves back into the monolith were successful and what they learned along the way, including which parts of Ruby on Rails helped or hindered them!

    Are you ready to revolutionize your coding environment? In a world dominated by VS Code and other Electron-based editors, there’s a hidden gem that developers are rediscovering: Vim. Or rather, Neovim. Just as Rails transformed web development, Neovim is redefining how we write code, blending decades-old technology with modern tooling for an unparalleled experience.

    **Workshop overview** In this hands-on workshop, we dive into the world of Neovim and Zellij — showing you how to streamline your development process and achieve a true flow state.

    **Here's what you can expect**
    * Introduction to Neovim: Understand the core principles that make Neovim a game-changer in the modern programming landscape.
    * Learn how to effortlessly manage and customize plugins to suit your unique workflow, shedding the bloat of heavier editors.
    * Combine the power of Neovim and Zellij to increase developer productivity by achieving your optimal flow state.

    **Key takeaways** By the end of this 75-minute workshop, you will:
    * Have a solid understanding of Neovim's capabilities and how it can enhance your productivity.
    * Manage workspaces using Zellij to jump in and out of projects with ease.
    * Walk away with a Neovim setup that empowers you to code with minimal distractions, maximizing your efficiency and creativity.

    **Why Attend?** This workshop is perfect for developers of all levels (with some familiarity with Vim) who are looking to optimize their workflow and embrace a lightweight, powerful, and highly customizable editor. Whether you’re new to Neovim or looking to deepen your understanding, this session will provide you with practical skills and insights that you can apply immediately.

    **Thank you Coder!** This workshop is brought to you by [Coder](https://coder.com/), and will be repeated on both days. It will be first-come, first-served.

    Incidents are an opportunity to level up, and on 22 Feb 2024 Intercom had one of its most painful outages in recent memory. The root cause? A 32-bit foreign key referencing a 64-bit primary key. Miles McGuire shared what happened, why it happened, and what they are doing to ensure it won't happen again (including some changes you can make to your own Rails apps to help make sure you don’t make the same mistakes.)

    Are you ready to revolutionize your coding environment? In a world dominated by VS Code and other Electron-based editors, there’s a hidden gem that developers are rediscovering: Vim. Or rather, Neovim. Just as Rails transformed web development, Neovim is redefining how we write code, blending decades-old technology with modern tooling for an unparalleled experience.

    **Workshop overview** In this hands-on workshop, we dive into the world of Neovim and Zellij — showing you how to streamline your development process and achieve a true flow state.

    **Here's what you can expect**
    * Introduction to Neovim: Understand the core principles that make Neovim a game-changer in the modern programming landscape.
    * Learn how to effortlessly manage and customize plugins to suit your unique workflow, shedding the bloat of heavier editors.
    * Combine the power of Neovim and Zellij to increase developer productivity by achieving your optimal flow state.

    **Key takeaways** By the end of this 75-minute workshop, you will:
    * Have a solid understanding of Neovim's capabilities and how it can enhance your productivity.
    * Manage workspaces using Zellij to jump in and out of projects with ease.
    * Walk away with a Neovim setup that empowers you to code with minimal distractions, maximizing your efficiency and creativity.

    **Why Attend?** This workshop is perfect for developers of all levels (with some familiarity with Vim) who are looking to optimize their workflow and embrace a lightweight, powerful, and highly customizable editor. Whether you’re new to Neovim or looking to deepen your understanding, this session will provide you with practical skills and insights that you can apply immediately.

    **Thank you Coder!** This workshop is brought to you by [Coder](https://coder.com/), and will be repeated on both days. It will be first-come, first-served.

    * This is not a real feature in Rails 8.

        Olivier shared a Gemfile structuring tip for enhancing team collaboration. By dividing the Gemfile, teams can have a shared dependency list plus individual `Gemfile.local` for personal tools.

        He spotlighted https://github.com/testdouble/standard, a RuboCop-based gem for consistent coding styles, and https://github.com/danger/danger, which automates code reviews by pre-screening pull requests. These gems streamline workflow and ensure code quality.

        Ben's contribution focused on the https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper gem, particularly its ability to manage feature flags, enabling developers to toggle features on and off in production. This approach allows for safer testing and incremental feature releases.

        He also shared insights into testing Stripe webhooks effectively within Rails apps, leveraging stripe test clocks (https://stripe.com/docs/billing/testing/test-clocks) for time manipulation during tests.

        Remote presentation

        Joel Hawksley is a staff software engineer at GitHub, based in Louisville, CO, USA. He's the creator of ViewComponent, a framework for building encapsulated, unit-testable view components in Ruby on Rails.

        In his talk, Joel will share reflections from five years of UI architecture at GitHub, focusing on three key lessons: native is the new baseline, design systems are victims of their own success, and frontend costs 10x backend.

  raw_title: BUILDING A HOME SECURITY SYSTEM WITH ELIXIR AND NERVES by Arto Bendiken

    Nerves is a framework for crafting bulletproof embedded software written in Elixir and deployed onto the rock-solid, nine-nines Erlang/OTP platform running directly on top of the Linux kernel.
    Arto will show how to get started with Nerves with the motivating example of a home security system running on a Raspberry Pi. To disarm the security system, you need to step in front of the camera and give a big smile.
    In addition to Nerves and Elixir, we will use deep learning with TensorFlow for face recognition.

    We all know that Ruby can give us superpowers, but can we use it do something truly magical - write a brand new Harry Potter completely automatically?
    It turns out that Ruby and the dark arts of Natural Language Programming are a match made in heaven! Using some basic NLP techniques, a dash of probability, and a few lines of simple Ruby code, we can create a virtual author capable of generating a very convincing Potter pastiche. And if the life of an author’s not for you, don’t worry. In the last part of the talk, we'll explore how we can apply what we've learned to everyday coding problems.

- title: Domain Modeling With Datalog
  raw_title: DOMAIN MODELING WITH DATALOG by Norbert Wojtowicz

    Datalog is a declarative logic programming language, which has in recent years found new uses as a graph query language in server and client applications. This talk introduces Datalog from its primitives and builds a mental model of how complicated queries can be resolved using simple data structures. This, in turn, will help you understand when and how you should apply Datalog in practice: on the client, on the server, as a graph database, as a communication protocol ala GraphQL/Falcor, or as an event-sourcing storage mechanism.

    In the 1980's, Nintendo had plans for a knitting add-on to the NES, with an interface that resembled Mariopaint, but with patterned sweaters as output. Sadly, this product never saw the light of day. Devastated on hearing this, a group of Airbnb engineers (who knew nothing about machine knitting) set out to hack a knitting machine from the 1980's to be computer-controlled. Learn about how we wrote our own yarn printer API in ruby and printed our first doge meme in yarn. And watch us as we send knit requests to our yarn server, and behold as it knits ugly sweaters from those images!

    Social coding revolutionized how we share useful code with others. RubyGems, Bundler, and Github made publishing and consuming code so convenient that our dependencies have become smaller and more numerous. Nowadays, most projects quickly resemble a Jenga tower, with layer upon layer of poorly understood single points of failure.

    If you've ever misspelled a word while searching on Google, you've benefitted from decades of distance algorithm development. In this talk we'll break down some popular distance measurements and see how they can be implemented in Ruby. We'll look at real world applications with some live demos. It won't matter if you get your kicks "Hamming" it up, if you drink your coffee in a "Levenshtein", or if you're new to Ruby: this talk is Rated R, for "all Rubyists". You'll be guaranteed to walk away with O(n^n) expectations met.

    Our brains are great at social interaction and pattern matching, but terrible at reasoning about the complicated non-human systems which dominate our world. Abstraction is the adapter between the fearsome complexity of the universe and our simple primate minds; when the real world is too intricate for us to manipulate directly, abstraction gives us big friendly levers to pull instead.

    I’ll explain how this single powerful idea underlies computers, mathematics, language and everything else we rely on in our daily work as computer programmers, and then show you how to use it effectively.

    Ruby is used for a lot of things, but for some reason, only a few people are using it for music. In a language that is meant to make programming fun, the lack of such creative code is scary. Let's fix the current landscape by learning how to use the tools available in Ruby (and some not) to let those creative juices flow. We will be focusing on how to build sounds from the ground up (the powerful amplitude, and the majestic waveform), so you don't need any prior audio wizardry. Just bring yourself and a Ruby console and we just might create some beautiful music in a beautiful language.

    Ruby makes it easy to prototype a new data model or codepath in your application and get it into production quickly to test it out. At GitHub, we've built on top of this concept with our open source dat-science gem, which helps measure and validate two codepaths at runtime. This talk will cover how we used this gem and its companion analysis gem to undertake (and complete!) a large-scale rewrite of a critical piece of our Rails app -- the permissions model -- live, side-by-side, and in production.

    As software becomes less monolithic and more service-oriented, log collection becomes a real problem. How can we stop hacking together brittle log parsing scripts and start building a unified logging layer?

    Fluentd is a data collector written in Ruby to solve this problem. Unlike other log management tools that are designed for a single backend system, Fluentd aims to connect many input sources into several output systems.

    This talk surveys Fluentd's architecture and shows real-world use cases of how different users extend it to do more with their logs with less code.

    What happens to Ruby when Rails dies?

    Ruby rode the Rails rocketship to worldwide renown. While a handful of us were writing Ruby code before Rails came along, most of us owe Rails a debt of gratitude for taking Ruby mainstream, allowing us to make a living writing code in a language we love.

    But opinions codified in Rails are falling out of favor. We're not writing apps that do heavy server-side rendering. Our apps have complex domain logic that grates against "The Rails Way."

    Is that it, then? Has Ruby entered its twilight years?

I'll discuss the history of the American Dream, how new programming education endeavors have repackaged it, and how the lack of awareness and analysis of this privileged rhetoric is damaging our culture and workforce.

In this talk, I will explain the algorihtnm, implementation and evaluation results about new GC.

    mruby forum released mruby 1.0.0 in Feb. 2014. It's been stable to use. However, because mruby is used on small boards or in application programs, it's hard to debug mruby applications. When we develop mruby application, we should write not only Ruby code, but also C code. So we need to debug both codes. To make debugging mruby application easier, we are writing prototype of mruby debugger. Current mruby distribution has no debugger, but there are some useful API sets to implement own debugger. In this talk, we introduce their API and how to use them to write a debugger.

    JRuby 9000 is the largest update to the JRuby platform during its lifetime. We will support Ruby 2.1 (or perhaps 2.2) features, replace our execution pipeline with a new optimizing compiler, support true native IO and Process logic, and finally bring character transcoding in line with MRI. At the same time, people are building more and more amazing things with JRuby. In this talk, we'll unveil JRuby 9000 and talk about the future of JRuby and Ruby.

With isometric development you can remove the boilerplate of web development and the cognitive load of switching between languages.

    Existing isomorphic web frameworks run JavaScript on the server. Volt lets developers write their app code in ruby and have it run both in the browser and on the server. Data is automatically synchronized to remove the need for REST API development.

Using the cardinal virtues as a framework, we can see that developers need courage to learn, temperance to prioritize goals, a sense of justice by which to discern, and wisdom to act. By being honest about where we lack virtue, and implementing steps to develop character, we can perform TDD on ourselves. This process can help us grow not only as coders, but as human beings.

We've used Capistrano + SSH + rsync, but it became a bottleneck, slower and slower, as well as server increases. Our developer have wanted to focus on development.

    As a language, Ruby plays fast and loose with the type system. Developers rely on duck typing to check that the things they want to do with an object are permissible. Whilst this freedom makes writing code frictionless and often a whole lot of fun, it doesn't always scale up well to writing larger systems.

    I can't promise that strong duck typing - adding automated checking to inter-object interfaces - will make writing complex systems easy but it will help you think about how to structure code in new ways and bring some of the lessons learned from other languages to the Ruby community.

    Ruby is notoriously difficult to optimize, but there is a solution: deoptimization. This means jumping from compiled code back to an interpreter, and it allows Ruby implementations to take shortcuts, make guesses and pretend Ruby is simpler than it is, but at the same time still be ready to handle the full language if it’s needed.

    You’ve seen talks about what makes Ruby slow: monkey patching, bindings, set_trace_func, object space & so on. We’ll show how with a Ruby implementation using deoptimization, such as JRuby+Truffle, you can use these features without any runtime overhead at all.

    Ruby's full of nice little metaprogramming tricks. Learning a new one's always the same cycle: 1. scared & tentative; 2. drunk on power; 3. woefully repentant; 4. mature & reasonable. Using my own history (of poor choices), I'll take you through stages 1-4 for: mazes of twisty little send calls, all alike! replacing def with method_missing! hook method indirection "magic!" Ill-timed define_methods! Sure, you could skip to the end - stage 4 is mostly "obey SRP; extract service objects" and "anonymous module inclusion's your BFF" - but getting there is half the point and all the fun.

    There's more to being a successful developer than simply being great at programming. The gotchas that slow us down or trip us up are often outside of the code we write, manifesting instead in our process or how we work with our peers. Whether you're new to programming or a veteran of many projects, these 5 things can improve your code, your career, and your team, and is a refresher course on what goes into the day-to-day, reminding us to have some empathy for individuals new to our community.

    be contributed back to Ruby itself. Suggesting a new Ruby feature isn't as daunting
    as it sounds. As long as you're diligent, you too can push ruby forward.

    During the last few years, the Ruby community invested significant effort into improving developer tooling. A lot of this effort has been divergent; trying out many solutions to find out what works best and fits Rubyists expectations.

    So where are we at this point? How do we compare to other ecosystems? Is it time to converge, unite efforts and reduce fragmentation? And where are we going next? Let’s analyze the full picture of Ruby tooling and try to answer these questions together.

    Have you ever heard of Ruby's Global VM Lock? Maybe you've heard of the GIL instead?

    Spoiler: It's an implementation detail of Ruby that can have a big impact on latency and performance of applications.
    At a high-level, it prevents Ruby code across multiple threads from running in parallel, while still safely allowing concurrency.

    Join me as we explore what the GVL is; what it is not; and how we can use the `gvl-tracing` gem to show it in action. We’ll also look into how Ractors, M:N scheduling and fibers fit into this story. By the end of the talk you’ll have the tools to evaluate if your own applications are being impacted, as well as learn a number of do’s and don’ts of Ruby performance.

    As an organiser of a local ruby meetup group I occasionally need to pluck names from a hat to announce winners of raffles or randomise the order of speakers for a particularly packed agenda. We can do that with actual bits of paper from a hat, but being a rubyist I'm much more interested in writing little ruby scripts to do it for me.

    We'll start with the obvious technique of using `Array#sample` but as it's not very interesting or satisfying to write we'll go a bit further. We'll look at interactivity using `Fiber`, and several attempts at animation using _why's Shoes framework. Finally, we'll explore my magnum opus of a terminal-based dungeon crawler (like nethack and rogue) written in ruby that introduces a human element of randomisation alongside the computer element.

    In order to understand the best-practices of time-series data, we’ll follow a surfer’s journey as she attempts to record every wave she’s ever caught. We’ll discover how to structure the time-series data, query for performant access, aggregate data over timespans, and present the data via an API endpoint. Surf’s up!

    Our modern-day concepts of GUIs, WYSIWYG, and IDEs were developed at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s. Alan Kay was one of the first employees, working on programming languages, among other things. He first released Smalltalk in 1972.

    While Ruby was not directly derived from Smalltalk, the two are surprisingly similar. We'll explore the history of Smalltalk, and the context in which it was formed. We'll see how Ruby rediscovered and reapplied Smalltalk's concepts, with an eye towards understanding Ruby's future.

    Ever wondered if some programming languages are weird by design? Welcome to the wild and wacky world of esoteric programming languages! The main focus of this talk will be to create a Ruby implementation of the image-based (gif/png/jpeg) language Piet. Can you imagine your source code as a picture of a cow?

    Rpiet starts as a naive port of one of the other language implementations of Piet. From there, we consider what is special about this language versus traditional programming languages. We then distill our initial implementation into a lean and mean version which verges on ROFLScale. It even includes a working graphical debugger!

    In Ruby, encountering `nil` is inevitable and often leads to frustrating bugs and NoMethodError exceptions. While `nil` is a crucial part of Ruby's design, it can be the source of elusive and hard-to-diagnose issues in your codebase. This talk explores an unconventional and experimental approach to debugging by "breaking" the nil object.
    How will we debug bugs?
    - extending the NilClass
    - customizing method_missing
    - creating methods dynamically with the previous options

    This is probably the wrong solution. Don't try this in production. However, we'll find bugs and it will be fun!

    Plan to scale or plan to fail: an evidence-based approach for improving systems performance by Jade Dickinson

    In this talk, I will present a methodology for replicating most standard Rails systems, for the purpose of load testing.

    You can use this to find out how your system performs with more traffic than you currently encounter. This will be useful if you are on a Rails team that is starting to see scaling challenges.

    At Theta Lake we operate at scale and are applying this methodology to proactively find ways to bring down our server costs. You don’t want to leave it until either your server costs soar out of control, or your entire system is about to fail. By seeing into the future just a little bit, you can find bottlenecks in your system and so find where you can improve its scalability.

    In this presentation, we'll summarize the problem we encountered while working with recursive callbacks, and give an overview of fibers in Ruby. Then, we'll put the two together and show you exactly how we ended up using fibers to solve an issue that was completely unrelated to concurrency.

    Can your application's code achieve complete perfection? If you join Professor X's School for Gifted Mutation Testers, it can get pretty dang close. Discover the Mystique of transforming your code in silly (and not-so-silly) ways, and seeing if this makes your tests fail. If your tests do fail, they are solid as a Colossus! If your tests passed, then you have discovered a Rogue mutant! But do not worry: I will teach you the ins and outs of squashing that mutant like a Blob and making your code stronger than Wolverine.

    Storm into this session and learn what mutation testing is all about, see if it may be right for your Ruby codebase, and explore the tools that make it possible. We will use the `mutant` gem and delve into an example Ruby app, bringing it to full mutation testing coverage through simplifying code and improving tests. Even if this technique is not right for your project, you will come away from this session with a deeper understanding of Ruby, code parsing, test-driven development, and writing clean, beautiful code.

    Have you had a chance to walk through every layer of a Hanami 2 web application? Here’s your chance. With the release of 2.2 this summer, all the basic building blocks are in place: with a zero-config database layer (built on ROM), and an optional but first-class operations layer that provides a flexible and consistent API for your domain operations.

    We’ll write a simple blog application across the entire suite of Hanami libraries. You’ll route a request to an action, which is responsible for parameters and delegating to the rest of your app. They are the gateway from the web into your app. From there we’ll create a record in the database and surface it back up to the action. The action’s final job is to render a view. That view is a ruby class that is responsible for preparing data to render in its simple logicless ERB template.

    We’ll end the workshop by dividing into small groups based on interest: extracting core business operations into their own classes, refactoring the view into different parts, or diving into the database by building more complicated queries.

    New Ruby developers often wonder how to write safe code in Ruby without
    static typing. In this workshop, we’re going to refactor working code to get the
    data validation and safety of static typing, but using Ruby’s existing features.
    We’ll show how to use coercions, data objects, the null object pattern, among
    others, and we’ll use Ruby’s debugger and console to show the power of Ruby’s
    flexibility. We’ll even see how improve your editor tooling. Then, we’ll discuss
    how static typing can work together with dynamic typing to make the most maintainable
    code. You’ll leave with a great set of tools for improving the code you work on
    daily.

    Reline is a pure Ruby implementation of GNU Readline and IRB uses it.
    GNU Readline allows you to write configuration in .inputrc, and Reline reads this
    configuration file and sets key bindings. However, there are many things that
    GNU Readline can do that Reline cannot. This session will introduce those features
    and talk about their implementation in Reline.

    Large Language Models (LLMs) have been rapidly evolving in recent years. They offer a completely different approach to challenges that were difficult to solve with classical algorithms.

    In this session, I will describe how RBS Goose, an LLM-based type inference tool I am currently developing, works and its current evaluation.
    For future improvement of RBS Goose, a more detailed evaluation mechanism is needed. In this regard, we will share ideas about TypeEvalRb, a type inference benchmark, by referring to examples from previous studies.

    Learn about the journey to resurrect an almost 20 year old ruby library, And all the amazing Ruby tricks it uses to be a fully featured MVC Web Framework.

    Ruby's semantics allow remarkable flexibility, and robustness. Let's walk through how Camping uses Ruby's best & hidden features to make a fully featured MVC Micro Web Framework, in a ridiculously small amount of code.

    Ruby's maturity promotes innovation and stability. Camping is almost 20 years old, and sat derelict unchanged for almost 8 years. To get it running with the latest versions of Ruby and its dependencies took only a couple of code changes.

    Camping isn't just another small micro framework written by a mad genius. It's the BEST ONE. Its small size and compact architecture makes it ideal for beginners, side projects, and small apps.

    # Key Takeaways.
    * Ruby is OP (Over Powered) and makes everything possible.
    * Framework Plugins in Ruby in a couple of lines of code.
    * Full Featured web server in like 100 bytes.
    * Put your whole app in one file.
    * Dynamic file lookups for views in a single line of Ruby.
    * Templating in 4 lines of Ruby? Yes!
    * HTML, CSS, Javascript... In your RUBY!
    * Rack conventions make ruby incredibly reliable, extensible, and extremely badass.
    * And more

    * Steps to ressurect Camping.
    * It doesn't run.
    * It Runs.
    * What does it do? Times ten. (Lots of small examples of interesting Ruby code that does interesting things in Camping)
    * Writing more tests.
    * Ok so it's actually broken and I didn't know and now it's fixed again.
    * Am I a Ruby Expert now?
    * No.

    # Session Highlights
    Ruby is great
    You can do so much with so little in Ruby
    How to make a Blog in 3 minutes
    Yes it's less than 5k
    Stickers

    Bonus I have physical boxed copies of Ruby Camping that you can win or buy.

    TRICK is an irregularly held Ruby programming contest that celebrates the most creative and weird Ruby programs. Among the many submissions, about a dozen particularly exceptional entries are awarded.

    Curious about what kind of programs win? It is a code like this, this whole text itself.

    ';BEGIN{eval$q=%q(def don(e)=e;def You(g)=at_exit{puts"You don'#{g}';BEGIN{eval$q=%q(#$q)};$s=%!#$s!"})};$s=%!
    puts %(Nb, lbh unir gb pbcl gur jubyr grkg, sebz "Ybh qba'g xabj" gb gur raq").tr("a-z","n-za-m")

    In this talk, we will showcase the winning entries from past TRICK contest and our own weird Ruby code.
    We will explore various techniques for writing such programs.
    By the end of this talk, you'll be ready to submit your original Ruby creations to TRICK 2025!

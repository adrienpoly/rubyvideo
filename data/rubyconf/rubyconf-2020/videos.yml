  speakers:
    - Aaron Patterson
  event_name: RubyConf 2020
  published_at: '2020-12-18'
  description: |-
    Ruby 2.7 introduced GC compaction, a way to reduce memory memory usage in your application. Unfortunately the compaction process is completely manual, requiring developers to determine the best time to compact their heap. This talk is about making the compaction process automatic and the challenges in doing so. We'll discuss various implementation techniques including read barriers and running the GC concurrently with the main program. This talk will have read barriers, but it won't have watch barriers, so come watch the talk!

    Expertise is a strange concept, and very hard to quantify at that. It's a state in which you exceed in a given field and can stand as an authority, a wellspring of knowledge and an inspiration to others in that field.

    For someone with autism and a particular obsessive streak expertise feels like a natural evolution of their interests into solidified knowledge and pragmatism.

    Expertise is also perhaps the most dangerous part of an autists career.


    Brandon Weaver
    Brandon is a Ruby Architect at Square working on the Frameworks team, defining standards for Ruby across the company. He's an artist who turned programmer who had a crazy idea to teach programming with cartoon lemurs and whimsy. He's also autistic, and would love to talk to you about your own experiences.

  description: |-
    Hashes seem simple. Set a key to a corresponding value, retrieve the value by key. What else is there to know?

    A whole lot, it turns out! Ruby makes several surprising choices about how hashes work, which turn hashes into dynamic powerhouses of functionality.

    We'll dive into how hashes work, understand how they form the groundwork for some extremely useful standard library utilities, and learn patterns to leverage the unparalleled versatility of the humble hash to write concise, performant, beautiful code.


    Ariel Caplan
    Ariel Caplan is a developer, speaker, and open source contributor. In past stages of life, he has been a biologist, periodical editor, molecular animator, rabbinical student, stem cell donor, and award-winning amateur poet.

    Ariel works at Cloudinary, developing new features on a Ruby app serving billions of image and video requests daily.

    He also enjoys finding, sharing, and learning new ways to see the tools we work with every day, and hopes this talk will help you do just that!

    The lights cut out. The crowd roars. It’s time. The band takes the stage. They’ve practiced the songs, particularly the covers. They’ve sound checked the coverage of the speakers. They know the lighting rig has the proper colored gels covering the lamps. They’re nervous, but they’ve got it all covered.

    Similarly, code coverage can give you confidence before your app performs on production and also tell you how live code is used (or not used). We’ll cover how to leverage ruby’s different coverage measurement techniques in concert to assist your crew and delight your audience.

    Programmers are not epidemiologists, but epidemiologists have never needed programmers more. Not for our viral opinions but for our ability to retrieve large data sets and make them understandable through expressive code. As the pandemic was silently taking hold in the United States in early 2020, I used simple web and Ruby tools to gather invaluable data from often obscure state data sources in order to understand the extent of the pandemic in my area. I never expected this would lead me to become a contributor to the pirate CDC.

    Olivier Lacan
    Olivier likes to use computers to help people. He maintained Code School for many years and now builds tools to support exciting new learning modalities at Pluralsight. He created those Shields.io badges that plaster your open source READMEs and tried to make those same projects more accessible with Keep a Changelog. Recently, he contributed to the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic and focused on uncovering pandemic data for the state of Florida.

    This talk is about the new feature of Ruby 3 for static type checking. The Ruby committer team had a plan to provide an optional static type checker for Ruby 3, but it is changed. Ruby 3 won't ship with a static type checker, but it will provide a feature called RBS to support type checker developments. In this talk, I will explain what RBS is, how the gem helps type tools developments, and what to do to get your gems ready for RBS.

    Did you know that Ruby 2.7 introduces a new method for manual memory compaction?

    Neither did I.

    Then a user reported a bug on a gem I maintain, and well...

    In this talk, I’ll tell you a story about how one bug forced me to learn all about memory management in Ruby. By the end of this talk, you should understand how memory is allocated on the heap, how Ruby implements garbage collection, and what memory compaction is all about!

  description: |-
    Ruby 3 will have a new feature Ractor, an abstraction for thread-safe concurrent/parallel execution. Because most of objects are not shared with multiple Ractors, Ruby programmer can enjoy parallel programming without some kind of difficult thread-safety issues. However, to keep objects isolation, Ractor introduces some limitation for the languages. For example, you can not use global variables on a multi Ractor program. This presentation will introduce about Ractor briefly and show the powers of Ractor and its limitations with interactive demonstration.

    Koichi Sasada
    Koichi Sasada is a programmer, mainly developing Ruby interpreter (CRuby/MRI). He received Ph.D (Information Science and Technology) from the University of Tokyo, 2007.

    Race conditions are a problem that crop up everywhere. This talk will go over what a race condition is, and what it takes for a system to be vulnerable to them. Then we’ll walk through four stories of race conditions in production, including one that we named the “Screaming Zombies” bug.

    You’ll leave this talk with a greater appreciation for how to build and analyze concurrent systems, and several fun stories for how things can go amusingly wrong.

    It's no secret that the upgrade to Ruby 2.7 is difficult — fixing the keyword argument, URI, and other deprecation warnings can feel overwhelming, tedious, and never ending. We experienced this first-hand at GitHub; we fixed over 11k+ warnings, sent patches to 15+ gems, upgraded 30+ gems, and replaced abandoned gems. In this talk we’ll look at our custom monkey patch for capturing warnings, how we divided work among teams, and the keys to a successful Ruby 2.7 upgrade. We’ll explore why upgrading is important and take a dive into Ruby 2.7’s notable performance improvements.

    When we use the words "coaching" or "mentorship," we tend to picture one-on-one conversations with someone we respect where there are questions asked and advice given. But restricting our vision of mentorship to this type of interaction is extremely limiting!

    Every activity during your workday is an opportunity to support your team members' career growth, including writing code, opening pull requests, and estimating tickets. In this talk, we'll identify strategies for coaching in our everyday technical activities and open our minds to look for opportunities in non-traditional places.

    When Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier for the first time, he set off a race around the world to do the same thing with a plane full of paying passengers. The US, Russia, UK, and France all wanted a piece of the inevitable fortune to be made building aircraft to cross oceans faster than sound itself.

    In the end, though, only one design flew passengers in significant numbers, the Anglo-French Concorde. Why? Let’s figure out what allowed the British and French to succeed where others failed. Along the way, we’ll learn a little about compromise and constraints and a lot about success itself.

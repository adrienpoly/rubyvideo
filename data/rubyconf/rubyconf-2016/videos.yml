    RubyConf 2016 - The Little Server That Could by Stella Cotton

    Have you ever wondered what dark magic happens when you start up your Ruby server? Let’s explore the mysteries of the web universe by writing a tiny web server in Ruby! Writing a web server lets you dig deeper into the Ruby Standard Library and the Rack interface. You’ll get friendlier with I/O, signal trapping, file handles, and threading. You’ll also explore dangers first hand that can be lurking inside your production code- like blocking web requests and shared state with concurrency.

    ***Contains explicit language***

    Because people are complex, diverse creatures, ensuring that your open source community is healthy, vibrant, and welcoming can be challenging. The good news is, science can help you understand human thoughts and behaviors, and the complexities of interacting in a collaborative way online. We'll discuss cognitive biases, the SCARF collaboration model, the online community life cycle, and how these things interact. You'll come away from this talk with a deeper understanding of yourself, your fellow humans, & the knowledge to improve personal interactions and the open source communities you belong to.

    RubyConf 2016 - Metaprogramming? Not good enough! by Justin Weiss

    If you know how to metaprogram in Ruby, you can create methods and objects on the fly, build Domain Specific Languages, or just save yourself a lot of typing. But can you change how methods are dispatched? Can you decide that the normal inheritance rules don't apply to some object?

    In order to change those core parts of the language, there can't be much difference between how a language is implemented and how it's used. In this talk, you'll make that difference smaller, building a totally extensible object model on top of Ruby, using less than a dozen new classes and methods.

    Performance, readability and correctness are fine and dandy, but what happens when we start optimizing for whimsy, illegibility and outright silliness? Self-rewriting programs that also function as ASCII art? Yup. Rewrite any JavaScript program only using six characters? Why not?

    Let's take a break from the practical and laugh at some of the most unbelievable code you've ever seen. Then let's pull out the magnifying glass to figure out how it actually works.

    Learn how to read the unreadable and how to write code that—to borrow a phrase from the Ig Nobel Awards—makes people laugh, then think.

    It was the perfect storm of events and circumstances: a first job, naïveté of inexperience, a fear of getting fired, and a loud boss prone to yelling. One morning, I realized that the first web “project” of my first job in my new career had gone horribly off track. What came to pass in the following weeks was the most involved and tense coverup I’ve undertaken in my life. This experience can tell us all about how we communicate with each other. How we can create environments where people can ask for help and how an atmosphere of pressure and tension can ruin a business.

I'll share the amusing stories behind why I always take a database backup, why feature flags are important, the importance of automation, and how having a team with varied backgrounds can save the day. Along the way I'll talk about a data center fire, deleting a production database, and accidentally setting up a DDOS attack against our own site. I hope that by learning from my mistakes you won't have to make them yourself.

The student was right, and it was almost hurricane season.

    The key to building a culture of innovation in your team is learning how to respond when mistakes inevitably happen. Let's let Bill LeMessurier teach us how to respond when it all goes wrong so that our creations can thrive despite our mistakes.

    OpenStruct, part of Ruby's standard library, is prized for its beautiful API. It provides dynamic data objects with automatically generated getters and setters. Unfortunately, OpenStruct also carries a hefty performance penalty.

    Luckily, Rubyists have recently improved OpenStruct performance and provided some alternatives. We'll study their approaches, learning to take advantage of the tools in our ecosystem while advancing the state our community.

    Sometimes, we can have our cake and eat it too. But it takes creativity, hard work, and willingness to question why things are the way they are.

    We often use color as a way to add information, whether in design, in UX, or for visualizations. When we visualize information, what's the best possible color scheme to use? How can we display the most possible information?

    The only way to know is to explore the nature of color! We'll build up to the color-handling code that exists in 'graphics.rb', a Ruby-language visualizations library. For free, we'll end up with intuitive models of computer color spaces and tricks for how to think about common color concepts like gradients and paint mixing.

    needs, what we’re doing wrong, and then we’ll outline the winning formula. If

Finally we'll cover experimental developments for the GC like heap splitting. Expect to leave this talk with heaps of pointers to add to your remembered set!

    RubyConf 2016 - Seeing Metaprogramming and Lambda Function Patterns in Ruby by Lukas Nimmo

    Metaprogramming and lambda functions in Ruby should be explained within their rightful place: living examples. You may have read tutorials on what these concepts are, but still do not understand when or why to use them. I dredged through over 50 prominent Open Source Ruby projects to bring you ten successful patterns that are used time and time again to create some of the most expressive and popular Ruby DSLs. Join me as we cover these patterns so that you can immediately begin using them in your own code to implement powerful DSLs. No vacuum-living, esoteric concepts here.

    RubyConf 2016 -  Even the Justice League Works Remotely by Allison McMillan

    "Remote welcome for senior level". This appears in countless job descriptions. Remote work is largely accepted in the developer community, but often only for very experienced developers. This fear is not without cause. Sometimes hiring remote developers at any level doesn’t turn out well but there’s generally a reason for that. Newer developers can also be very successful remote workers. In this talk, you’ll learn what to look for when hiring remote developers at any level and non-senior developers will learn what characteristics to keep in mind in order to have a successful remote experience.

    How does Ruby allocate memory? Ever wonder why that poor application of yours is using hundreds of megabytes of RAM? Ruby's garbage collector means that we don't have to worry about allocating memory in our programs, but an understanding of how C Ruby uses memory can help us avoid bloat and even write faster programs. We'll talk about what causes memory allocation, how the garbage collector works, and how to measure memory activity in our own Ruby programs.

What if you changed your application code instead? In this talk, you'll learn what "listening to your tests" means in the real world: no mysticism, no arrogant TDD purism, just a few practical refactorings you can use tomorrow at work.

    That's why I wrote Suture, a gem to help at every step:

    In development, new code is verified against recorded calls
    In staging, old & new code is ensured side-by-side
    In production, unexpected errors fall back to the old code
    With renewed confidence and without fear, you grab the card. You've got this.

    Test doubles (which you may know under the alias “mock objects”) are the most misunderstood and misused testing tools we've got. Starting with the fact that nobody can agree on what to call them. Contrary to what you may have heard, test doubles do not inherently lead to fragile tests. What they do is hold up a harsh mirror to the assumptions in our code. They are the light saber of testing tools: a more elegant weapon for a more civilized age. But be careful not to cut your code in half, so to speak. Herein: a guide to using test doubles without losing your sanity.

Using frameworks like JRubyFX and Shoes 4, among many GUI and graphics libraries, JRuby makes client-side development fast and powerful. With an embedded JVM, JRuby runs your app on mid-level embedded devices without compiling a line of code. And JRuby is still the best way to power up your Rails 5 app. Come learn how to use JRuby everwhere!

We'll use a mixture of C and Ruby as our modelling languages: C is the lingua franca of the VM world whilst Ruby is the language which brought us monkey-patching...

    In JRuby+Truffle we have a radical solution to this problem – we’re going to interpret the source code of your C extensions, like how Ruby interprets Ruby code. Combined with a JIT this lets us optimise Ruby but keep support for C extensions.

    "Argh, why is this so slow?!" We've all asked questions like this without getting satisfying answers. And so we slog along, finding workarounds and architecting around the slow bits.

    But what if we had a friend who could see things we can't? Someone who could say whether our guesses were right, and what to look at next?

    DTrace is that friend, and it's here to help! In this talk, I'll show you how DTrace can answer incredibly general and specific questions about systems performance, and help us to generate new ones. Along the way, we'll see that it's easier to use than you might think!

    A few miles from this convention center, Teespring prints millions of short-run custom products every year from modern direct-to-garment printers and ships them all over the world. Like most companies, Teespring's architecture is polyglot, but the core business logic is in Ruby. We'll discuss how we use large at-scale manufacturing and production systems to help anyone, anywhere turn their ideas into reality.

    To mock or not mock is an important question, but let's leave it apart and admit that we, Rubyists, use mocks in our tests.

    Mocking is a powerful technique, but even when used responsibly, it could lead to false positives in our tests (thus, bugs leaking to production): fake objects could diverge from their real counterparts.

    In this talk, I'd like to discuss various approaches to keeping mocks in line with the actual implementation and present a brand new idea based on mock fixtures and contracts.

    How do you find the most unmaintainable code in your codebase? What will you prioritize in your next technical debt spike, and why?

    In this talk you will learn how you can use RubyCritic, SimpleCov, Flog, Reek, and Skunk to slay dragons in your next refactoring adventure! Find out how the relationship between churn, complexity, and code coverage can give you a common language to talk about code quality and increase trust in your code.

    Did you know Ruby optimizes your code before executing it? If so, ever wonder how that works? The Ruby VM performs various optimizations on bytecode before executing them, one of them called peephole optimizations. Let’s learn about how some peephole optimizations work and how these small changes impact the execution of Ruby’s bytecode. Do these small changes make any impact on the final runtime? Let's find out - experience reading bytecode is not needed!

    Depending on where you live, money can be a prickly topic in the workplace; however, survey after survey shows it’s also a conversation many employees actively want started. Data also shows that transparency around wages increases trust and job satisfaction and improves gender and racial salary equity.

    However, just because folks want something doesn’t mean getting there will be smooth sailing (as we discovered when we instituted wage transparency three years ago). In this talk, we’ll discuss why salary transparency matters, ways it can manifest, and how to pitch it to the rest of your company.

    You’ll use our established blueprint to draft a successful internship program throughout this workshop. We'll walk through all the planning phases and help you set up the templates so you're ready to make it a win for all involved and "sell it" to management. By the end, your internship program will be prepared to hit the ground running, so your interns will be productive on day one.

    Have you ever felt curious towards functional programming (FP)? Were you, soon afterwards, intimidated by the mystic terms like monads and functors? Do you think FP is not related to your Ruby work and thus, useless? Guess what–you can actually apply FP to your Ruby projects and reap benefits from it before fully understanding what a monad is!

    This talk will walk you through the powerful mental models and tools that FP gives us, and how we can readily use them to improve our apps in a language that we all love and understand.

    In this case-study based presentation, we’ll explore a variety of problems such as composing Enumerable methods, generating a series of custom objects, and how to provide a clean interface for a collection with multiple valid traversal orders. Beyond just the beloved Enumerable module, this talk will take you into the world of Enumerators and Ranges and equip you to write objects that bring joy to your teammates.

    There’s just one problem. Our customers also want soup! And, our machine is not extensible. So, we have a choice: we can add to the complexity of our machine by jamming in a new dispenser with each new request; or, we can pause to make our machine more extensible before development slows to a halt.

Broad enough to be applied to a range of workflows, flexible enough to be tailored to an individual’s personal development routines; these principles are not in themselves complex, and can be performed regularly in the day to day of working in a codebase.
    Learn how to cultivate habits and a culture of incremental automation so even if the goal is not a full self-service suite of automated tools, your team can begin a journey away from friction and manual tasks.

We’ll cover real-life examples and how to apply the four tenets of NVC– observations, feelings, needs, and requests– to bring more joy and fulfillment the next time you pair.

    Pluck It by Adam Cuppy

    How many times have you written the same bits of code, over and over, and thought, “You know, if only this was big enough to be a gem, I would pluck it out." Often, we think of a RubyGem as a larger library of code that we “bolt on” to an app. And, these smaller code blobs become a hassle to distribute to the multiple apps that use them.

    A small micro-library, done the right way, at the right time, can greatly improve an app.

    But, when can you benefit from extracting a micro-library? And, how do you build and publish that code into a RubyGem? I'll go through the process, from A to Z.

    The Not So Rational Programmer by Laura Eck

    Cognitive biases are heuristics that the brain uses to process information and quickly come up with decisions. They are generally pretty useful, but they aren’t perfect processes and can often lead to suboptimal decisions or behaviors.

    This talk will help you to recognize their patterns in your thinking and behavior and (since we unfortunately can’t quite de-bug our own brains yet) to monkey-patch them - in order to become a more efficient, more cooperative and ultimately more successful developer.

    This is about Ruby's Virtual Machine. Specifically MRI's Virtual Machine. We will take a dive in to how your Ruby code is compiled in to byte code and how that byte code is executed. Once we get a grip on how the VM works, we'll see how to make it perform tricks the likes of which you've never seen! Ok, maybe you have seen them, just not with MRI's virtual machine.

    How to Stop Hating your Test Suite by Justin Searls

    Your app is a unique snowflake. Your tests are too… but they shouldn't be!

    Years helping teams write better tests has taught me one thing: consistency is crucial. Inconsistent tests slow teams down, wasting time to understand how each test works. Deciding on conventions—even arbitrary ones—can prevent tremendous pain later.

    This talk will introduce a ready-to-fork Test Style Guide of carefully-considered rules and templates for Rubyists. You can customize it to fit your preferred tools, too. Soon, you'll be on your way to having more consistent tests that are much more fun to maintain!

    Your own 'Images as a Service'

    The average web page size is greater than 2MB, and increasing. And great swathes of that are images. Serving the right size of image can vastly improve the experience for your users. But while we're arguing about whether Rails is slow or not we're chucking vast images at peoples phones over EDGE connections.

    Serving images should be a 'solved' problem, just like it is for 'hosting' or authentication. However lots of solutions make poor default suggestions. What can we do for our users with 100 lines of code, Sinatra, a single gem and a CDN?

    I decided to find out.

    In this presentation, we'll explore a simple ORM that uses the Repository and Data Mapper patterns. We'll also see how using these patterns enables us to write simpler model code.

    Making it on your own and the pitfalls of gem dependencies by Nikki Murray and Maggie Epps

    Putting "require '[gem name]'" at the top of your Ruby file and running 'gem install' or 'bundle install' can be an easy way to solve a difficult problem. But you could be potentially adding hundreds of lines of code you didn't write or read, for only half a of a fix. Did the gem actually solve your problem or is it just an approximate solution? How much research did you do on that gem first? Are there hidden security risks in it? In this talk, you will learn how to evaluate gems for fit, figure out when it makes more sense to write your own, and how to go about writing your own.

    Your code is your partner. It struggles against you, but also alongside you. Your code comes to you as it is, not as you wish it were. Like a real-life partner, it has a history that you’ll never fully know; like a real-life child, it bears your imprint, but it is wild, unruly, and fiercely self-sovereign. You’ll never stop working with code that’s hard to figure out or difficult to change. But this code, this stubborn creature, is entrusted to you. Let go of your anger at the developer who wrote it. Let go of the terror of being blamed for its unforeseeable regressions. Let go--and find joy.

Why can't we just gem install the gems we need? Join me for a walk through the reasons that Bundler exists, and a guide to what actually happens when you use it. Finally, we'll cover some Bundler "pro tips" that can improve your workflow when developing on multiple applications at once.

    Code, Culture and the Pursuit of Happiness by Kinsey Ann Durham

    Life’s good. People who never thought they could code are becoming developers. Outreach programs are getting people in, but we’re facing an even bigger problem. Getting them to stay there. 57% of women alone leave the tech industry. The root cause of people leaving, and not just people from underrepresented backgrounds, points to company culture. Let’s build company cultures the way we build products, applying scrum principles we use everyday. This talk dives into the reasons why people are leaving the industry in droves, and what unexpected, actionable steps we can take to solve this problem.

    Softly, softly typing by John Cinnamond

    The ruby community is large and varied but, for the most part, we haven't rushed to engage with type theory. Static typing - whatever that is - is for the slow moving world of Java developers. Type theory is for Haskell weirdos.

    All that could be about to change.

    In his keynote at Rubyconf 2014 Matz spoke about some ideas for Ruby 3, including the idea of adding static typing - or more specifically soft typing - to the language. So what is soft typing? How do we understand more about it? And what does it mean for us mere developers?

    Estimates are like weather forecasts. Getting them right is hard, and everybody complains when you are wrong. Estimating projects is often critically important to the people who pay us to develop software.

    We can do better. We can focus our estimates on the parts we do well, like estimating complexity. We can present estimates without falsely inflating them, and we can be transparent during the development process. The humble point estimate can help you, if you understand its limitations.

    Better estimates and communication of estimates will make your projects run more smoothly.

    In this talk we'll look at some of the extremely defensive patterns that have been driven out in RSpec through the years. We'll look at building Ruby that works across a range of interpreters (including 1.8.7!). We'll investigate how you can write code that defends against objects that redefine methods like send, method and is_a?.

    You should come to this talk if you want to learn about method resolution in Ruby, and cross interpreter design patterns.

    When a Rubyist hears "concurrency" they usually Google Elixir, Go, or even Node.js. Turns out, Ruby can be great for concurrency! The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) does NOT prevent Ruby programs from performing concurrently. In this presentation we'll discuss the true meaning of concurrency, explore the inner-workings of the GIL, and gain a deeper understanding of how the GIL effects concurrent programs. Along the way we'll write a bunch of concurrent Ruby code, run it on multiple interpreters, and compare the results.

    Many Ruby domain-specific languages go for beauty over usability - and it shows, when you try to use them. But one of programming's oldest, most common DSLs - regular expressions - is both as ugly and as persistent as a cockroach. What makes regexes tick? By breaking down their design, we'll learn concrete principles that go deeper than "Englishy:" principles like "composability" and "deep domain integration." We'll learn how to get precise about the API design and boundaries of our DSLs. We'll write a micro-DSL that is usable without monkeypatching.`

    The Joy of Miniature Painting by Caleb Thompson

    As developers, we often stare at a computer screen all day only to come home and stare at more glowing boxes all night. Having a productive, nontechnical hobby can really help to keep us sharp for our day jobs.

    You'll watch me live-paint a small model for a game called Warmachine while I describe some of the techniques I use. You'll hear about how painting has helped me to clear my mind after work, keeping me away from burnout I might encounter if I wasn't exercising a different brain lobe.

    Afterward, I'd love to chat about painting and playing games.

    Using Ruby In Security Critical Applications by Tom Macklin

    We’ve worked to improve security in MRI for a variety of security critical applications, and will describe some of our successes and failures in terms of real-world applications and their various runtime environments. We will describe some of the security principles that guide our work, and how they fit in with the ruby culture. We will also introduce some objectives we have moving forward to improve ruby’s security, and ways we’d like to engage the community to help.

    Keynote: Consequences of an Insightful Algorithm by Carina C. Zona

    Coders have ethical responsibilities. We can extract remarkably precise intuitions about people. Do we have a right to know what they didn't consent to share, even when they shared data leading us there? Balancing human needs and business specs can be tough. How do we mitigate against unintended outcomes? In this talk, we look at examples of uncritical programming, & painful results of using insightful data in ways that were benignly intended. You'll learn practices for examining how code might harm individuals. We’ll look at how to flip the paradigm, for consequences that are better for all.

    String Theory and Time Travel: the humble text editor by Colin Fulton

    Did you know that the time machine in your text editor is probably broken? Better yet, have you considered that your text editor has a time machine?

    The majority of our day is spent in a text editor, but most never think about how they really work. There is a lot more to an editor than saving a few keystrokes or the rivalry between Vim and Emacs; they can teach us about data structures, IO, design, and the dangers of time travel.

    Let's take a closer look at some of the most enduring applications, and see what we can learn by trying to build a better editor using Ruby.

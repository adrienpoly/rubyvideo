    To mock or not mock is an important question, but let's leave it apart and admit that we, Rubyists, use mocks in our tests.

    Mocking is a powerful technique, but even when used responsibly, it could lead to false positives in our tests (thus, bugs leaking to production): fake objects could diverge from their real counterparts.

    In this talk, I'd like to discuss various approaches to keeping mocks in line with the actual implementation and present a brand new idea based on mock fixtures and contracts.

    How do you find the most unmaintainable code in your codebase? What will you prioritize in your next technical debt spike, and why?

    In this talk you will learn how you can use RubyCritic, SimpleCov, Flog, Reek, and Skunk to slay dragons in your next refactoring adventure! Find out how the relationship between churn, complexity, and code coverage can give you a common language to talk about code quality and increase trust in your code.

    Did you know Ruby optimizes your code before executing it? If so, ever wonder how that works? The Ruby VM performs various optimizations on bytecode before executing them, one of them called peephole optimizations. Let’s learn about how some peephole optimizations work and how these small changes impact the execution of Ruby’s bytecode. Do these small changes make any impact on the final runtime? Let's find out - experience reading bytecode is not needed!

    Depending on where you live, money can be a prickly topic in the workplace; however, survey after survey shows it’s also a conversation many employees actively want started. Data also shows that transparency around wages increases trust and job satisfaction and improves gender and racial salary equity.

    However, just because folks want something doesn’t mean getting there will be smooth sailing (as we discovered when we instituted wage transparency three years ago). In this talk, we’ll discuss why salary transparency matters, ways it can manifest, and how to pitch it to the rest of your company.

    Starting an internship doesn’t have to reduce your team's progress. On the contrary, a quality internship can benefit interns and senior folks. And, it doesn't take much to set up and start. We've done over 100!

    You’ll use our established blueprint to draft a successful internship program throughout this workshop. We'll walk through all the planning phases and help you set up the templates so you're ready to make it a win for all involved and "sell it" to management. By the end, your internship program will be prepared to hit the ground running, so your interns will be productive on day one.

    Functional programming brings you not just fun, but also profit!

    Have you ever felt curious towards functional programming (FP)? Were you, soon afterwards, intimidated by the mystic terms like monads and functors? Do you think FP is not related to your Ruby work and thus, useless? Guess what–you can actually apply FP to your Ruby projects and reap benefits from it before fully understanding what a monad is!

    This talk will walk you through the powerful mental models and tools that FP gives us, and how we can readily use them to improve our apps in a language that we all love and understand.

    Ruby has some of the best tooling in the business for working with iteration and data series. By leveraging its full power, you can build delightful interfaces for your objects.

    In this case-study based presentation, we’ll explore a variety of problems such as composing Enumerable methods, generating a series of custom objects, and how to provide a clean interface for a collection with multiple valid traversal orders. Beyond just the beloved Enumerable module, this talk will take you into the world of Enumerators and Ranges and equip you to write objects that bring joy to your teammates.

    Mechanical coffee machines are amazing! You drop in a coin, listen for the clink, make a selection, and the machine springs to life, hissing, clicking, and whirring. Then the complex mechanical ballet ends, splashing that glorious, aromatic liquid into the cup. Ah! C’est magnifique!

    There’s just one problem. Our customers also want soup! And, our machine is not extensible. So, we have a choice: we can add to the complexity of our machine by jamming in a new dispenser with each new request; or, we can pause to make our machine more extensible before development slows to a halt.

    Until Ruby 3.2 the `is_a?` method can be a surprising performance bottleneck. It be called directly or through its various synonyms like case statements, rescue statements, protected methods, `Module#===` and more! Recently `is_a?` and its various flavours have been optimized and it's now faster and runs in constant time. Join me in the journey of identifying it as a bottleneck in production, implementing the optimization, squashing bugs, and finally turning it into assembly language in YJIT.

    Automation doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Automating manual processes is a practice that one can employ via simple principles. Broad enough to be applied to a range of workflows, flexible enough to be tailored to an individual’s personal development routines; these principles are not in themselves complex, and can be performed regularly in the day to day of working in a codebase.
    Learn how to cultivate habits and a culture of incremental automation so even if the goal is not a full self-service suite of automated tools, your team can begin a journey away from friction and manual tasks.

    To navigate the vulnerability of sharing our keyboard and code, let’s learn about nonviolent communication (NVC), an established practice of deep listening to ourselves and others. We’ll cover real-life examples and how to apply the four tenets of NVC– observations, feelings, needs, and requests– to bring more joy and fulfillment the next time you pair.

    Getting started with TDD is hard enough without having to also navigate a programming language barrier. Many of the best books on testing focus on very different languages like Java, making it tricky to apply their advice in Ruby, especially if you're new to testing. I'll go through the most important practices and techniques that we can pull from the testing literature and show how they can be applied in your day-to-day Ruby development. You'll learn how to make the most of testing in Ruby using the patterns, practices, and techniques that popularized TDD in the first place.

    Some Assembly Required by Aaron Patterson

    Let's write a JIT for Ruby, in Ruby! We're going to learn how a JIT works from the ground up by building TenderJIT, a pure Ruby JIT compiler. First, we'll learn how Ruby's virtual machine works, then we'll learn how to plug a JIT in to the virtual machine. Finally, we'll generate machine code from our Ruby programs. By the end of the presentation we'll have a working JIT that converts Ruby code in to machine code all written in pure Ruby! But don't forget: some assembly is required!

    Your Team, as Saga by Betsy Haibel

    Software systems are made of code, and the people who work on them. But most of all, they're made of the stories those people tell. Heroic legends of shipping to deadline, spooky ghost stories of refactors gone bad... and a lot of sci-fi, projecting out into a utopian (or dystopian) future. How can you edit this story to make it go right? In this talk, we'll apply fiction-writing tricks to the art of engineering roadmapping. We'll learn how to build narratives, develop our characters, and world-build our way to healthier teams and healthier code.

This talk dives into the technical details and tradeoffs of how each of these tools parses and subsequently understands your applications. After, we'll discuss how you can do the same with your own projects using the Ripper standard library. You'll see just how far we can take this library toward building useful development tools.

    Ten years ago, Boeing faced a difficult choice. The Airbus A320neo was racking up orders faster than any plane in history because of its fuel efficiency improvements, and Boeing needed to compete. Should they design a new plane from scratch or just update the tried-and-true 737 with new engines?

    The 737 MAX entered service seven years later as the result of that and hundreds of other choices along the way. Let’s look at some of those choices in context to understand how the 737 MAX went so very wrong. We’ll learn a thing or two along the way about making better decisions ourselves and as teams.

What do you do if the dependencies span multiple layers? What if the dependencies are implicit? If we can't find the best level of isolation, test doubles can be unwieldy very quickly and they will make the test, as well as the future you, miserable. In this talk, we will look at symptoms that produce unreliable and unmaintainable tests, and develop a strategy that will make your test suite more resilient and actually enjoyable.

    Understanding arrays deeply is a powerful step forward in writing concise, beautiful, semantic Ruby.

    We began adopting gradual typing on Shopify's giant monolith almost 3 years ago. Today, we are running the monolith with great type coverage and even see some internal teams commit to stricter typing in their components.

    The road to get here was not easy, though. We had to work with our developers to solve the right problems at the right levels of abstraction to ensure the adoption was healthy. This talk will go over some of the challenges and some of our wins along the way. It will also help you decide if gradual typing might work for your codebase and your team, as well.

    Backtraces are very useful tools when debugging problems in Ruby programs. Unfortunately, backtrace generation is expensive for deep callstacks. In older versions of Ruby, this is true even if you only want a partial backtrace, such as a single backtrace frame. Thankfully, Ruby 3 has been optimized so that it no longer processes unnecessary backtrace frames, which can greatly speed up the generation of partial backtraces. Join me for an interesting look a Ruby backtraces, how they are generated, how we optimized partial backtraces in Ruby 3, and how we fixed bugs in the optimization in 3.0.1.

    At Grailed, these situations were not uncommon. We are the largest marketplace for luxury men's fashion, with over 7 million users, and a growing Rails codebase that spans hundreds of thousands of lines. Before typing, changes to core interfaces often required creative grepping, modification of type checking unit tests, and updating brittle type documentation.

    Root is reinventing the broken insurance industry by using technology in smartphones to measure driving behavior. The Root app measures things like smooth braking and turning to determine who is a safe driver and who isn’t. By only insuring good drivers, we can offer more affordable rates. And the software the engineering team built from scratch powers it all.

    If you or someone on your team ran away to join the circus, how stressful would it be for the rest of the team? How can we minimize that?

    After a year+ in a pandemic, many are considering taking new roles or extended PTO. It's more important than ever to invest in minimizing our "circus factor" and building resilient teams so that everyone can unplug and do what's best for them with as little stress as possible. In this talk, we'll discuss low-friction changes you can make today so that if you join the circus tomorrow your team is empowered and enabled for continued success.

    Ruby’s current memory model assumes all objects live in fixed size slots. This means that object data is often stored outside of the Ruby heap, which has implications: an object's data can be scattered across many locations, increasing complexity and causing poor locality resulting in reduced efficiency of CPU caches.

    Join us as we explore how our Variable Width Allocation project will move system heap memory into Ruby heap memory, reducing system heap allocations and giving us finer control of the memory layout to optimize for performance.

    To discuss these questions, we'll explore Perceptual Learning (PL) research. PL is a natural learning process that complements traditional Education. It accelerates expertise by speeding pattern recognition, intuition and fluency on a given subject.

    In this talk, we'll learn how to create expertise based on PL's techniques, and how you can apply them to become an expert Ruby developer.

    So much talk about good software revolves around finding the “right abstraction”. Even programming itself is an act of abstracting the world into some form of bits and bytes. If, like me, you missed out on a proper introduction to such a fundamental concept, this talk will teach you what abstraction is and why it’s important to software development.

    We’ll also dig into a real-world example of fighting a troublesome abstraction and learn strategies for identifying when one no longer works for you—the first step toward imagining new abstractions for your code to take shape.

    Parallelizing tests is an opportune way of reducing the total runtime for a test suite. Rails achieves this by forking multiple separate workers that fetch tests from a queue. In Ruby 3, Ractors introduced new mechanisms for executing code in parallel. Can they be leveraged by a test framework? And how would that compare to current parallelization solutions?

    Let’s find the answers to these questions by building a test framework built on Ractors, from scratch. We’ll compare the current solutions for parallelization and what advantages or limitations Ractors bring when used in this context.

    Everyone knows that to build great software you need great teams. Experts are quick to offer principles and processes that are “the key” to greatness.

    But what if your team’s not “great”? It’s not “getting things done”. People don’t trust each other. There’s a lot of conflict. Low morale. Something is wrong.

    Now what?

    “Debugging” a team is a lot like caring for a complex distributed software system: it’s less about fixes, and more about observation, hypotheses, intervention, and more observation. Whatever your role, these are skills you can learn and apply right now, on your own teams.

    In the aftermath of John Allspaw's hugely influential "Blameless Post-Mortems",
    blamelessness has become a shibboleth for modern production operations teams.
    But it seems that something has been lost in translation. Organizations that try
    to "be blameless" without understanding blame often make activities taboo that
    can lead to blame. But many of them (like attribution and event analysis) are
    not inherently harmful — and they are necessary for learning. When we throw the
    baby of learning out with the bathwater of blaming, we also lose opportunities
    to become more resilient.

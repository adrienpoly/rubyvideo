  description: '"In the beginner''s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert''s
    mind there are few." - Shunryu Suzuki, from "Zen Mind, Beginner''s Mind" The Japanese
    Zen term shoshin translates as ‚Äúbeginner‚Äôs mind‚Äù and refers to a paradox: the
    more you know about a subject, the more likely you are to close your mind to further
    learning. In contrast, the beginner‚Äôs state of mind is judgment free. It‚Äôs open,
    curious, available, and present. We‚Äôll draw on examples of these mindsets from
    fields as varied as aviation and geology, and discover lessons we can apply to
    the world of software development.'

    up, going from the micro to the macro. You‚Äôll leave more empowered to start changing
    the climate in your own workplace.

  description: Simulated annealing is a fascinating algorithm that's designed to help
    find a particular type of solution (near-optimal, aka "good enough") to a particular
    type of problem (constrained optimization). It's inspired by the science of metallurgy,
    and because it's grounded in a real-world process I find it incredibly approachable.
    In this talk I'll explain in plain terms about what simulated annealing is, what
    a constrained optimization problem is, why you might want a "good enough" solution,
    and how we can use the Annealing gem to add simulated annealing to our Ruby apps.

  description: Object Oriented Design is powerful for organizing software behavior,
    but without the benefit of lambdas' code-as-data flexibility, it often fails to
    reduce solutions to their simplest form. Although Ruby's Enumerable functionality
    is widely appreciated, its lambdas generally are not. This presentation introduces
    the developer to lambdas, and shows how they can be used to write software that
    is cleaner, simpler, and more flexible. We'll go through lots of code fragments,
    exploring diverse ways of exploiting their power and identifying reusable functional
    design patterns along the way.

    In fact, Ruby pushes the boundaries of developing such apps in brand new ways

    syntax including bidirectional data-binding, thanks to Glimmer DSL for LibUI,
    a gem that won a Fukuoka Ruby 2022 Special Award. In this talk, I will cover concepts

  description: Wondering how to get involved in supporting your communities? Hear
    from someone who has spun up (and down) multiple volunteer and service projects.
    May it spark your imagination -- and your heart -- to join or start helping out
    both this wild world and yourself. New mutual aid groups formed around the world
    in 2020. The tools were not ideal and the volume overwhelmed volunteers. A handful
    of of tech folx built a fit-to-suit app to manage immediate needs and maximize
    impact of partner mutual aid groups. Wins were achieved. Lessons were learned.
    And the interconnectedness of all things was felt.

  description: 'Like most web applications, you run important jobs in the background.
    And today, some of your urgent jobs are running late. Again. No matter how many
    changes you make to how you enqueue and run your jobs, the problem keeps happening.
    The good news is you''re not alone. Most teams struggle with this problem, try
    more or less the same solutions, and have roughly the same result. In the end,
    it all boils down to one thing: keeping latency low. In this talk I will present
    a latency-focused approach to managing your queues reliably, keeping your jobs
    flowing and your users happy.'

  description: In this talk, we will go on a journey through Zappi‚Äôs data history
    and how we are using Ruby, a graph database, and a bitmap store to build a unique
    data engine. A journey that starts with the problem of a disconnected data set
    and serialised data frames, and ends with the solution of an in-memory index.
    We will explore how we used RedisGraph to model the relationships in our data,
    connecting semantically equal nodes. Then delve into how a query layer was used
    to index a bitmap store and, in turn, led to us being able to interrogate our
    entire dataset orders of magnitude faster than before.

  description: In software, we often encounter problems that we accept as "just how
    things are." But sometimes, that creates opportunities to identify creative, out
    of the box solutions. One idea can be combining the power of Crystal with our
    existing Ruby knowledge, to create effective tools with minimal learning curve
    and cognitive overhead. I'll demonstrate how easily Ruby code can be ported to
    Crystal, how it can benefit us, and how to identify these opportunities.

  event_name: RubyConf 2022
  published_at: '2023-03-06'
  description: Blocks are one of the most expressive parts of the Ruby syntax. Many
    Ruby methods take a block. When a method is given different blocks, there is a
    crucial optimization necessary to unlock the best performance. This optimization
    dates back to the early days of research on dynamic languages, yet it seems only
    a single Ruby implementation currently uses it. This optimization is called splitting
    and what it does is using different copies of a method and specialize them to
    the block given at different call sites. This enables compiling the method and
    the block together for the best performance.

  description: As the world moves towards real-time there‚Äôs a growing demand for building

    has involved spinning up separate task-specific tooling, learning new and unfamiliar
    paradigms, as well as deploying and operating a constellation of complex services.

    to build and deploy real-time stream processing applications using Ruby.

  description: What would happen if your team dropped that standing Monday morning
    refinement meeting? Chaos? We often follow work processes because they‚Äôre ‚Äúthe
    way things are done‚Äù, but clunky, unexamined processes slow down even talented
    teams. Never ending backlogs make it hard to feel like you‚Äôre making progress.
    Frequent meetings break up focus. If something about the way we work doesn‚Äôt help
    us move more quickly or effectively, it‚Äôs time to rethink it. Seeking a better
    way to coordinate work across 3 continents, the Workforce.com dev team adopted
    the Shape Up approach to project management. This talk explores the core elements
    of that approach and ways to optimize developer happiness while delivering more
    value for users.

  description: If you have ever built a web application, chances are that you have
    also had to deal with "the back office" - the chores and one-off tasks required
    to operate your software in production. Workflows that aren't user-facing, like
    creating promo codes, moderating content, or running reports, are often a janky
    combination of admin scripts and spreadsheets. Retool helps developers quickly
    and easily solve these problems with software instead. In this session, we'll
    show how to build a back office interface for a Ruby on Rails application using
    Postgres and several common API services, so you can keep your focus on the business
    in the front, and let Retool help throw the party in the back (office).

  description: To help us with aspects like linting, security or style, many of us
    have Rubocop analyzing our code. It's a very useful tool that is widely used,
    easy to set up and configure. Rubocop can even automatically auto-correct your
    source code as needed. How is this even possible? It turns out that Ruby is really
    good at taking Ruby code as input and doing various things based on that input.
    In this talk, I will go through some of the internals of Rubocop to show how it
    analyzes and makes changes to your source code.

    but I can tell you what we won't be covering: \n* Sinatra \n* Hanami \n* roda
    \n* merb \n\nWe will answer questions like: \n* Why are fewer people experimenting
    with their own frameworks today? \n* What features, idioms and ideas are worth
    exploring? \n* Are any of these frameworks worth reviving or copying?"

    re-implemented the core library, writing it in Ruby itself, and made it available
    as a gem? Would it be faster or slower? Would it be easier to understand and debug?
    What other benefits could there be? It was originally Rubinius that implemented
    Ruby‚Äôs core in Ruby, and it has been taken up and maintained by the TruffleRuby
    team.

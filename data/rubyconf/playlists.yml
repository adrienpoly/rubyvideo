    Focused on fostering the Ruby programming language and the robust community that has sprung up around it, RubyConf brings together Rubyists both established and new to discuss emerging ideas, collaborate, and socialize in some of the best locations in the US. Come join us in Los Angeles for what will surely be the best RubyConf yet!

    One of our key goals for RubyConf is to provide an inclusive and welcoming experience for all participants. To that end, we have an anti-harassment policy that we require ALL attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and staff to comply with — no exceptions.

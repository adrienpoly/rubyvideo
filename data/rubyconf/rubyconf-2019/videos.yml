    RubyConf 2019 - Thomas Edison vs Three Teslas in a Trenchcoat by Coraline Ada Ehmke

    As a company grows, adopting new technologies becomes more complex, costly, and risky. But as developers we want to keep our skills up-to-date and are often drawn to the latest and hottest tools. So how can we effectively experiment with new technologies at work in a responsible way? This talk will recount the famously adversarial relationship between Thomas Edison and Nicola Tesla, and from their story we will learn ways to balance and exploit the tension between the boring and the new, the familiar and the shiny, the safe and the unknown.

    by Noah Gibbs\n\nYou feel guilty about not knowing enough \"Computer Science.\"
    But that isn't what you're still missing in your coding. If you could just pick
    up any problem and solve it, you wouldn't care if you used a formal-sounding algorithm
    to do it.\n\nThere's a way to get that \"fingertip feel\" for coding. And it comes
    from mindful, conscious practice.\r\n\nSounds abstract, doesn't it? Instead, it's
    very simple, specific and concrete. We'll go over the basic steps, the pitfalls,
    and how to do it. It works whether you're a beginner or an expert. You'll be able
    to create coding studies for yourself, not just find other people's exercises
    that are already worked out for you.\r\n\nThis talk is in Ruby. But the technique
    works with any language, library or paradigm. It's also good for pairing.\n\n#confreaks

    RubyConf 2019 - No Return: Beyond Transactions in Code and Life by Avdi Grimm

    At the root of catastrophes in both code and life lies a pervasive fallacy: the attempt to model processes as if they were transactions. Join me for an honest, sometimes raw retrospective on two decades of building a software development career. We’ll examine how personal philosophy impacts software design—and vice-versa. We’ll encounter the Transactional Fallacy, and how it can hinder our attempts to build resilient systems. And we’ll explore how a narrative-oriented mindset can lead to both better code and a more joyful life.

    RubyConf 2019 - Principles of Awesome APIs and How to Build Them by Keavy McMinn

    We know the theory of what makes for a good API: it should be consistent, stable, and well documented. However, when we struggle to put good principles into practice, the API becomes difficult for your teammates and frustrating for your users. So, how do we pragmatically implement APIs in line with good principles? In particular, how do we get a bundle of engineers to do this together?

    This is a talk for those curious about designing, building, and maintaining modern APIs. We’ll look at specific tooling and strategies to help improve and maintain the quality, consistency, and stability of your API. You’ll learn how to proactively make improvements to these areas, and how to make it easier to shepherd API development in your company.

    When was the last time you got an un-Googleable error? The kind that takes you and your lead three days to debug, with weird generic stacktraces deep in framework internals? What if you could approach that bug with something other than trial, error, and tears? Metaprogramming can come to the rescue -- just not the kind you do in production. In this talk, you'll learn strategies for investigative metaprogramming. You'll learn how to insert debugging hooks anywhere and instrument anything. You'll even learn how to turn that information into actionable bugfixes.

    encoding&#39;s

    Character encoding happens every time we interact with a computer or any digital device. There is no such thing as plain text. Understanding how encoding works, how Ruby handles encoding issues, and how to strategically debug encoding snafus, can be a great asset in your developer toolbox. We will cover a bit of history, dive deep into Ruby's encoding methods, and learn some tricks for managing encoding in your application.

    DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages) are fun to design, but it's easy to forget that they are still "Just Ruby." If users of your DSL can mix in Ruby code... any Ruby code... you can bet they will, and it's all too easy for that to go awry. In this session, you'll encounter examples of how seemingly innocuous Ruby code can make a DSL go disastrously wrong, and you’ll learn techniques you can use to harden your DSL against the cleverness of your users. If you’re writing, or even thinking of writing a DSL, this talk is for you.

In the process, we will also get a crash course on how HTTP works.

    RubyConf 2019 - The Fewer the Concepts, the Better the Code by David Copeland

    How many people could change the code you wrote yesterday if they had to? I hope to convince you that the larger that number, the better your code, and the key is to manage conceptual overhead. The fewer things someone has to know to read and modify your code, the better for you, your team, your company, your app. We'll see real examples of code that we'll put on a conceptual diet. We'll then talk about what that reduction actually does to code quality.

    RubyConf 2019 - The Singleton Module and Its Pattern In Ruby by Mike Calhoun

    The singleton design pattern allows for the creation of an object that is restricted to one single instance. No matter how big or complex your application is, there will only ever be one. This has caused some controversy about the quality and maintainability of code that leverages it. Yet, Ruby’s standard library contains a module that implements this pattern. Let’s take a closer look at this module and the “controversy” around its implemented pattern. Let’s also consider singletons in Ruby and the purpose they serve for the language in general.

We’ve built quality editor tools like jump-to-def and seen many contributions from a growing community. Within Stripe, we've used Sorbet to drive code quality via measurable, concrete indicators.

    We’ll share these improvements and give an update on our collaboration with Matz and the Ruby 3 Types working group. Suitable for anyone using Ruby—no familiarity with Sorbet needed! Come follow in the footsteps of the many companies already using Sorbet.

    RubyConf 2019 - A Static Type Analyzer of Untyped Ruby Code for Ruby 3 by Yusuke Endoh

    Ruby 3 is planned to provide a toolchain for static analysis: (1) the standard type signature format for Ruby code, (2) a type analyzer to guess a signature of a non-signatured Ruby code, and (3) a type checker (such as Sorbet) to verify a code with its signature. In the talk, we present a candidate of (2), called Type Profiler, which aims to allow you not to write a signature manually. It abstractly runs a non-annotated Ruby code in "type" level, tries to find possible errors, and generates a type signature prototype for the code. We show some demos and development progress.

Now, would it amaze you to learn that our best friend Ruby can help us make our own tracks like these?

    Language as a Tool of Thought: Consistency versus Progress by Victor Shepelev

    Our programming language is not a mere instrument: it shapes how we think about problems, what we feel right and wrong. But as the Ruby itself changes (and rather quickly, lately), what happens with our understanding and feeling of it? More powerful language is probably good, but how should it stay consistent and true to its spirit without losing the pace of the progress? Let's look closely at some new and upcoming Ruby features, and some missing and rejected ones, and discuss where are we standing currently in regards to consistency and "developer's happiness".

    Like MRI, mruby initializes all classes before execution. This has a negative impact on Ruby's initialization speed and memory. This increase in memory usage is particularly fatal for mruby. We have created a new mrbgem to solve this issue. The key idea is pre-execution; we actually run mruby and do initialization, generate the structures in the form of C source code, and recompile it. In this session, we will look at the initial behavior of the mruby through an introduction to our tools.

    Story by Amy Newell & Nat Budin\n\nA 3-month project stretches out to 9 months.
    It's widely viewed as over-engineered and difficult to work with. But months after
    deployment, it's considered successful. What happened?\n\r\n\nIn this talk, a
    principal engineer and a director of engineering recount the extraction of a social
    feeds GraphQL service from a decade-old Rails monolith. Along the way, we'll cover
    topics including selling a big project, complexity in remote work, complexity
    in deployments, and complexity in emotions. We'll tell you about the scars we

    RubyConf 2019 - In the beginning, there was "require"... by Adam McCrea

    Almost every Ruby program begins with the "require" method, but many of us don't pause to think about what it's doing until it fails us.

    What happens when we call "require"? How does Ruby find what we're looking for? Is Bundler somehow involved? What about "requirerelative" and "requiredependency", and what the heck is a "binstub"?

    This talk will guide beginner and intermediate Rubyists through these foundational concepts that power our Ruby programs, from single-file script to a behemoth Rails 6 app.

    by Christian Bruckmayer\n\nPointers, managing memory and static typing - writing
    C code is hard! However, most programming languages, including Matz's Ruby Interpreter
    (MRI), are implemented in a low level programming language. So you think without
    knowing these concepts, you can not contribute to Ruby? Wrong! Although MRI is
    implemented in C, fortunately there are Ruby's in Java, Go and even Ruby itself.\n\r\n\nIf
    you ever wanted to learn about Ruby internals without being a C expert, this talk
    is for you. Join me on my journey of re-implementing hash maps in JRuby, breaking
    bundler and actually learn to write (some) C code.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"

    RubyConf 2019 - Elasticsearch 5 or and Bust by Molly Struve

    Breaking stuff is part of being a developer, but that never makes it any easier when it happens to you. The Elasticsearch outage of 2017 was the biggest outage our company has ever experienced. We drifted between full-blown downtime and degraded service for almost a week. However, it taught us a lot about how we can better prepare and handle upgrades in the future. It also bonded our team together and highlighted the important role teamwork and leadership plays in high-stress situations. The lessons learned are ones that we will not soon forget. In this talk, I will share those lessons and our story in hopes that others can learn from our experiences and be better prepared when they execute their next big upgrade.

    Ruby 2.7 will feature a manual heap compactor integrated with the GC. In this presentation we'll cover how Ruby's memory is arranged, how compaction can be helpful to your application, as well as algorithms and implementation details of the heap compactor. As a bonus, we'll cover GC debugging techniques as well! This presentation is going to be heaps of fun. Don't turn the page because we're going to scan the stack for some great pointers!

    accumulate many kinds of debt. Each debt comes in the form of small qualitative
    shortcomings we (knowingly or unknowingly) choose to ignore in the name of shipping.
    They cause friction -- and over time they can combine to easily grind momentum
    to a halt if left unchecked. While these kinds of debt can in fact be useful (if
    not necessary) to creating software - teams need to understand the nature of their
    shortcomings to prevent \"velocity bankruptcy.\"\n\r\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss
    the nature of process debt by using classical ideas related to \"unproductive
    behavior\" as a guide: hitting on shortcomings in culture, empathy, discipline,
    morale, organization, preparedness, and requirements. We'll discuss examples,
    tips on identifying the risks in your own projects, and how to decide when to
    avoid, mitigate, or accept and track these risks.\n\n#rubyconf2019 #confreaks"

    are the current hotness for deployment. But, how about development? They can provide
    a good way to manage local dependencies even if you're just writing a gem instead
    of an app. While writing and running code directly on your laptop has its own
    obstacles, using containers for development is not a silver bullet and brings
    along its own set of headaches. Which cases do containers make sense and how would
    they be configured? Containers may not be for you, but we'll go through some example
    setups. It'll be up to you whether or not you want to change your local setup
    after this talk.\n\n\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"

    What if Professor X and Magneto formed the X-Men together? What if Jessica Jones had joined the Avengers? What if Tony Stark wrote Ruby? (Okay, I made that last one up, but we'd probably all read it.) This talk, in the mode of Marvel's What if... ? comics, explores what Ruby 3 might look like if key decisions in its history had been (or might be) made differently. We'll look at three "what if"s in particular: "what if Ruby had a static type system?", "what if Ruby ran in the browser?", and "what if Ruby didn't have a global interpreter lock?"

    4 Programming Paradigms in 45 Minutes by Aja Hammerly

    One of the most important lessons I've learned is that programming languages are tools and not all tools are good for all jobs. Some tasks are easier to solve functionally. Some are clearly suited for OO. Others get simpler when you use constraint solving or pattern matching.

    Let's go on a whirlwind tour of 4 different programming languages emphasizing different programming techniques: OO, functional, logical, and procedural. You'll leave this talk with a better understanding of which languages are best suited to which types of jobs and a list of resources for learning more.

    Compiling Ruby by Kevin Newtown

    Since Ruby 2.3 and the introduction of RubyVM::InstructionSequence::load_iseq, we've been able to programmatically load ruby bytecode. By divorcing the process of running YARV byte code from the process of compiling ruby code, we can take advantage of the strengths of the ruby virtual machine while simultaneously reaping the benefits of a compiler such as macros, type checking, and instruction sequence optimizations. This can make our ruby faster and more readable! This talk demonstrates how to integrate this into your own workflows and the exciting possibilities this enables.

    Git Driven Refactoring by Ashley Ellis Pierce

    Often we know that our code needs refactoring, but we have no idea where to start. Maybe we studied some common code smells and learned about the things that we should be avoiding, but memorizing the rules doesn’t automatically lead to fixing all problems. In this talk, we explore how you can use Git to recognize and address violations to each of the SOLID principles. Using diffs, commit history and pull requests you can learn to recognize patterns in code that point to problems. These same tools can help you correct those issues and write more maintainable code.

    Packing your Ruby application into a single executable by  Minqi Pan

    Recent languages like Go compiles a project into a nice executable, why can't good ol' Ruby? We have built an packer for Ruby to do just that. It is 100% open-source, and can produce executables for Windows, macOS and Linux individually. By packing, distributing Ruby apps are made extremely easy, additionally with intellectual property protection. Auto-updating is also made easy, in that the executable only needs to download and replace itself. So, how we did it? How to use it? What goes under the hood? What future will this bring to Ruby? That's what will be unraveled in this talk!

    Programming history is filled with bugs that turned out to be features and limitations that pushed developers to make even more interesting products. We’ll journey through code that was so ‘bad’ it was actually good. Along the way we'll look at the important role failure plays in learning. Then we’ll tame our inner perfectionists and tackle an approach to writing code that will help us fail spectacularly on our way to coding success.

    Deterministic Solutions to Intermittent Failures by Tim Mertens

    Monday mornings are bad when the coffee runs out, but they’re even worse when all of your impossible to reproduce, “flaky” tests decide to detonate at the same time.

    Join us to learn a systematic, proven workflow for expertly debugging any test failure including consistent, order-related, and non-deterministic failures. We’ll discuss the importance of fixing intermittent failures before they reach critical mass and why you should eradicate the term “flaky tests” from your vocabulary.

    Don’t wait for an emergency to prioritize fixing the ticking time bomb of intermittent test failure.

    High Cost Tests and High Value Tests by Noel Rappin

    There is a value in writing tests and there is also a cost. The currency is time. The trade-offs are difficult to evaluate because the cost and value are often seen by different people. The writer of the test bears much of the short term cost while long term benefits and cost are borne by the rest of the team. By planning around both the the cost and value of your tests, you’ll improve your tests and your code. How much do slow tests cost? When is it worth it to test an edge case? How can you tell if testing is helping? Here are some strategies to improve your tests and code.

    Finding Responsibility by Caleb Thompson

    In 2011, with a team of interns at a Department of Defense contractor, I created a Wi-Fi geolocation app to locate hotspots. It could find the location in 3D space of every hotspot near you in seconds. We made formulas to model signal strength and probable distances. We used machine learning to optimize completion time and accuracy.

    I was so caught up in the details that it took me months to see it would be used to kill people. What do we do when we discover that we're building something immoral or unethical? How can we think through the uses of our software to avoid this problem entirely?

    Quick: say something about Ruby that hasn't already been said.

    Not easy, right? This community is prolific. In thousands of talks, Ruby's story has been told and retold. We heralded programmer happiness, path of least surprise, and confident code. We unleashed metaprogramming (until we tamed our DSLs). We built apps, tested them to death, and then legacy-rescued them.

    What's left to say? We could tell the same stories again, but that wouldn't be very DRY. What we need to hear was often said years ago, so this talk will help us rediscover timeless lessons from our community's greatest hits.

    You've just woken from a coma to find out that Ruby has fallen victim to the programming apocalypse. Walkers have taken over the programming world looking to infect any developers they can find. Posing even more of a threat are the other survivor camps such as Java and PHP all fighting to survive by any means necessary.

    After reuniting with the Ruby Community, it's time to fight for survival. Ruby developers who remained safe in the post-apocalyptic Ruby community need a leader to keep the community together and keep the language thriving. Are you willing to step up to keep Ruby alive?

    If contributing to open source was only about writing code, it would be easy. In reality open source exposes our insecurities and makes us feel vulnerable. Vulnerability can inspire change, but can also paralyze us for fear of not being good enough. In this talk we'll look at how vulnerability affects open source contributors and explore how maintainers can foster a welcoming community. Contributors will learn how to identify projects with empathetic leaders who value GitHub’s community standards. Cultivating a better environment for contributing makes open source more sustainable for all.

Well cover low level and high level memory measurement tools, how to use them, and what they're telling us. We'll cover copy-on-write optimizations and how our GC impacts them. After this talk you should have a better understanding of how Ruby's memory management interacts with the system memory, how you can measure it, and how to adjust your application to work in concert with the system's memory.

We present and demonstrate some esoteric, obfuscated, and even artistic programs that we have ever created, including a program that contains a spinning globe, a robust program that can have any single character removed and still works, a program that consists only of alphabetical letters, and so on. We will also review the implementation techniques.

    Programming requires developing ideas about How Things Work that we internalize and rely on in our day-to-day programming life: when I write a class, I can use it like this; all strings have that method; I'm allowed to use private methods in these contexts. We start to rely on them. But which are rules, and which are more like norms? Turns out that with as dynamic a language as Ruby, a lot of rules are made to be broken. Let's take a look at what we can assume to be true in our Ruby programs and what we can't.

I kept hearing about the benefits of functional programming (simplicity, immutability, thread safety), but it wasn't until I reimplemented familiar Ruby concepts in a functional language that I really got it. In this talk, we'll steal some powerful FP ideas from Clojure and use them to rewrite Rack. You'll come out of it understanding how to write functional Ruby code that is simpler to reason about, less likely to break, and dead simple to debug.

    Human Errors by Olivier Lacan

    Runtime errors can sometimes turn into dark and unpleasant journeys which lead you to question the nature of reality. Thankfully, Ruby often provides friendly feedback for understanding the cause and remedy for exceptions. Yet, there are situations in which programmers don't receive clear enough context for what really caused an exception and how to address it. We'll look at Ruby's error feedback mechanisms and search for constructive ways in which they can be made more helpful to humans.

    make mruby more portable: Why and How by Yurie Yamane & Masayoshi Takahashi

    Physical computing is very fascinating and fun, but there are also difficulties that were not found in normal Ruby programming. One of the issues is its low portability. Unlike PC, some computer boards that directly uses the devices use only small microcomputer whose memory is less than 1 MB. So most of the applications work only on specific boards. If we found an interesting project, we could not try it unless I had a target board. To solve it, I propose a plan of mruby platform, consisting of a group of mrbgems that absorb incompatibilities. I talk about the project and current progress.

    Improving TruffleRuby’s Startup Time with the SubstrateVM by Kevin Menard

    Ruby applications can be broadly split into two categories: those that run for a short period and those that stick around for a while.

Over the years, alternative Ruby implementations have demonstrated remarkable performance gains for long-lived applications -- so-called peak performance -- but often lose out to MRI for short-lived applications.

    In this talk, I'll introduce the SubstrateVM and show how we use it to massively improve TruffleRuby's startup time with minimal impact on peak performance.

    RubyConf 2017: Buuuuugs iiiiin Spaaaaace! by Colin Fulton

    Space is really cool. From precision electronics, to giant rockets, spacecraft can represent the best of engineering. But sometimes things go wrong. Terribly wrong.

    What do exploding Soviet rockets have to do with Agile development?
    How did LISP and Forth hacking save part of the Galileo probe?
    What about that time astronauts added life-saving monkey patches... while orbiting the moon!
    Exactly how much damage can a little dead code do? (Hint: a lot!)
    This talk is for anyone whose love of a good space story is rivaled only by their passion for incredibly resilient software.

    Steal This Talk: The Best Features Ruby Doesn't Have (Yet) by John Feminella

    One of Ruby's greatest strengths is its burning desire to make writing software enjoyable for humans. Newer languages, perhaps taking some inspiration from Ruby, have recognized the practical value of doing this. What can Rubyists learn from these new ideas, and what can be adapted from them to improve Ruby?

    In this talk, we'll discuss a few of the most interesting Ruby-like features that aren't really in Ruby yet. We'll also show how you can get these features (or an approximation to them) with Ruby today. By the end of the talk, you should feel empowered to try them out yourself!

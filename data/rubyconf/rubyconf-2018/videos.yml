    RubyConf 2018 - The Atonement of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Caleb Thompson

    The Nazi party members at Nuremberg, J. Robert Oppenheimer at Los Alamos, and developers at exciting tech companies have something in common. The responsibility for what mark we leave on the world through our efforts or inventions rests on our own shoulders. We cannot push this burden to those who tell us what to do, and so we must be conscious about what it is that we're building and how it will be used. The repercussions of our actions come back to us if not legally, then weighing on our conscience.

    There is nothing quite like the excitement of leading a team of engineers while your company is in the middle of a growth spurt. Before you know it you start to notice that the work habits that used to work great just don’t seem to be that effective anymore.

    In much the way that cooking for two is quite different from cooking for two hundred, building your systems for scale requires a different approach to your work.

    In this talk we will explore antipatterns that start to show up during growth and some techniques that you can use to address them.

    We all play games. Not video games, but the “games” of communication and power between humans.

    Even the most rational of us may be unaware of the drivers of our behaviour and the impact it has on our ability to work well with others.

    Find out how an awareness of our state of mind, our biases and the dynamics of human communication can help us to understand each other, ourselves, and build better software.

    The talk introduces Rubyplot - the plotting library created for Ruby. It focuses on the general design of a plotting library, its influence from John Hunter's Matplotlib, the design decisions that were influenced by Ruby and provides a perspective of the language from the eyes of a newcomer.

    The talk further argues why Ruby should be used for scientific computing and urges Rubyists to contribute to the development of scientific frameworks.

    Machines are all around us: recommending our TV shows, planning our car trips, and running our day-to-day lives via AI assistants like Siri and Alexa. We know humans should act ethically, but what does that mean when building computer systems? Are machines themselves—autonomous vehicles, neural networks that diagnose cancer, algorithms that identify trends in police data—capable of ethical behavior? In this talk, we'll examine the implications of artificial moral agents and their relationships with the humans who build them through the lens of multiple case studies.

    How many different roles are there on engineering teams? Officially, there's probably just a manager and maybe a tech lead. Unofficially, you have technical specialists, company veterans, people focused on tools, and those who think deeply about the product.

    In this talk we'll steal the best ideas from operating rooms, wartime deployments, and courtroom litigation. We'll see how it's possible to train, reward, and empower your teammates by respecting their uniqueness while also making room for very junior developers to join fast-moving teams.

    Quick and easy visualization is an important teaching tool and a wonderful way to see your ideas in action. Unfortunately, it is neither quick nor easy for rubyists to get from idea to visualization. You have to have a ton of extra stuff installed. You need to know game mechanics/math. You need to learn a whole other way of programming. It isn't something that is easy for a beginning programmer to pick up. This talk describes an alternative graphics and simulation library with a very clean API making it incredibly easy for newbs and experimenters to go from idea to visual simulation. Pew pew pew!

    RubyConf 2018 - Unraveling the Masculinization of Technology by Audrey Eschright

    Have you ever wondered where the perception that technology is a masculine pursuit comes from? Or why we have to explain that, "no really, women are interested in computers too"? At the beginning of the modern technological era, to be a computer was to be an actual literal woman—someone trained in math and computations. Decades later, women are underrepresented in most technical pursuits, with an increasingly “leaky” pipeline leaving fewer and fewer throughout our career progression. Learn about the gendered history of computing and explore how we can write a new narrative of participation.

While HTTP-REST by itself can enable access to your service, an API client library can provide significant benefits in safety, security, readability, and ease of use. In this session, you’ll learn API client design patterns and best practices honed from releasing hundreds of APIs at Google, and you’ll discover tools that can take the tedium out of building, testing, and documenting your API clients for Ruby, and across other languages.

    Rubyists are creators. While we’re traditionally tasked with building digital products, our skills can cross into the physical medium too. This talk demonstrates a non-typical way to use code to create products: building a Ruby program that generates dynamic plans for laser-cut physical products (e.g. laptop stands, picture frames, notebooks, etc). With size, fonts and patterns as variables, our app programs a system that allows a user, or a computer, to design an infinite number of variants. Attendees will leave inspired to explore new avenues to use their skills to do what we do best: create.

    Fake news spread six times faster in social media than true stories. As technologists, our industry has built the tools that enable the spread of disinformation across social, the web, and beyond. But fake news is nothing new, it has been a part of each advancement in the technology that powers the spread of information, from the printing press to blogging. What makes fake news so appealing? Is it a tech problem or a human problem? In this talk, I will explain the psychology that makes fake news appealing to our brain, and what technology can learn about this psychology to build better tools.

Our early-career developers are learning client management and team leadership skills that they wouldn’t usually get to practice until they stepped into a senior role.

    We tackle unique business challenges but are solving similar problems, and all too rarely will we talk through our designs and mistakes. Integrations, external APIs, data-stores - these might not be pure code but we can learn a lot from good object design when scaling our systems.

    In this talk we’ll discuss how parts of a distributed systems rely on each other, how data flow can couple and propagate failure, and how common emergent patterns can encapsulate services to be resilient.

    This is a journey of close calls, errors, and design smells researched into how a service gets simplified.

    In poker, as in software, variance is real and you can do everything correctly and still lose the hand.

    In this talk, we'll talk about real post-mortems and problems with their conclusions. We'll rebalance our thinking to see when we might be learning the wrong lessons. We will learn about poker, taking risks, and a little about life.

    RubyConf 2018 - The Anatomy of a Ruby Gem: Going From Zero to Sharing Code by Tony Drake

    To many Rubyists just starting out, gems can appear very mysterious. You list them in a Gemfile and run 'bundle install' or install them directly with 'gem install'. Suddenly, your programs gain more functionality than they had before. But what are gems? What makes them work? How can you make your own to share with the world? Let's find out.

    Who loves getting paged at 3am? No one.

    In responding to incidents -- either at 3am or the middle of the day -- we want to feel prepared and practiced in resolving production issues. In this talk, you'll learn how to practice incident response by simulating outages in production. We'll draw from learnings from our simulations at Stitch Fix, like technical implementation strategies, key metrics to watch, and writing runbooks. You'll walk away from this talk with the superhero ability help your team simulate incidents in production.

    Be prepared for your next incident!

    In this presentation, we'll cover techniques in Ruby 2.6 that reduce "dead space" memory overhead found in all Ruby programs today. First, we'll cover the compilation process of Ruby programs, instruction optimizations, as well as internal data structures used for running Ruby code. Next, we'll look at how to use this information to maintain liveness of Ruby objects in the code. Finally, we'll take all the information we covered so far to develop a technique for reducing dead space in the heap. Remember to mark your calendar because this presentation will be remembered for generations.

    Is your technical interview optimized? Could it use a refactor?

    Do you ask candidates questions that could actually influence your production codebase? Or, do you ask them about problems that are solved and standardized? Or worse, contrived and trivial?

    Have you ever asked any of these questions:

    Find min or max in a list
    Implement a sorting algorithm
    FizzBuzz (or any contrived algorithm)
    “Now can you do it recursively?”
    Leverage your production code and commit history to make your next interview more effective in identifying the right hire. All while having more fun.

Distraught, Red asks his master for advice, and she sends him off on a grand journey to learn the true powers of the reduce method by reimplementing various methods from Enumerable.

    Join Red on an illustrated adventure through the land of Enumerable as he learns to map, select, find, and more using his trusty reduce.

    Sometimes your fastest queries can cause the most problems. I will take you beyond the slow query optimization and instead zero in on the performance impacts surrounding the quantity of your datastore hits. Using real world examples dealing with datastores such as Elasticsearch, MySQL, and Redis, I will demonstrate how many fast queries can wreak just as much havoc as a few big slow ones. With each example I will make use of the simple tools available in Ruby to decrease and eliminate the need for these fast and seemingly innocuous datastore hits.

    Many people believe that ruby applications are inherently slow, yet oftentimes it is the lack of optimization and not the language that is at fault. But how do you even get started with this daunting task of performance optimization? For those that do not have a computer science background, understanding all the different ways of algorithm optimization can sound scary and overwhelming. Some may have a good handle on the theory behind things like the big O notation, but struggle to put it in practice. This talk will focus on a tangible and data driven way to measure and optimize code performance.

    RubyConf 2018 - Building Serverless Ruby Bots by Damir Svrtan

    Want to build a Bot without the hassle of provisioning and managing servers? Amazon’s got a service for that and it’s called AWS Lambda - it executes your code only when needed, scales automatically and you pay only for the compute time you consume.

    There’s one problem with Lambda - it doesn’t support Ruby! Let’s checkout multiple options on how to build a Ruby Bot and package it into an executable which you can run on any machine without the need to actually have Ruby installed.

    RubyConf 2018 - The New Design of Ruby's Documentation by ITOYANAGI Sakura

    Unlike many other languages, Ruby doesn't have great design for documentation. Perl has "perldoc" feature and users easily access documents of modules by "perldoc" command. Python has "docstring" feature and users can access it on REPL. Those are each language's design of importance. The features are not just tool, it contains toolchains and eco-systems. Users of these languages benefit from good documentation design, so library authors write good documentation for them.

    I'll talk about new Ruby 3's standard documentation design. It pretty improves your development experience.

    RubyConf 2018 - Beating Mastermind: Winning with the help of Donald Knuth by Adam Forsyth

    Come solve logic games with Ruby, learn about minimax algorithms, and turn a paper into code. There are lots of "solved" problems out there that don't have a good library available -- learn how to write one yourself. We'll take a paper written by Donald Knuth (the "father of analysis of algorithms" and author of "The Art of Computer Science") and use it to solve a game called Mastermind that many people (including me) played as children. We'll look at the game, walk through the paper, turn the prose and math into code, understand minimax algorithms, and never lose at Mastermind again!

    RubyConf 2018 - Eiffel's Tower by Nickolas Means

    When Gustave Eiffel built his namesake tower, it was nearly twice as tall as the tallest structure on Earth. His crews built it in an astounding 22 months, pioneering new construction techniques to deliver it in time for the opening of the 1889 Exposition Universelle. It was amazing then, and it’s just as captivating today.

    We all say we want to do groundbreaking work, but what does it actually take to push an organization forward? The answer starts long before the work itself. Let’s see what we can learn from how Gustave Eiffel went about building his record-shattering tower.

    RubyConf 2018 - High-speed cables for Ruby by Vladimir Dementyev

    Modern web applications actively use real-time features. Unfortunately, nowadays Ruby is rarely considered as a technology to implement yet another chat – Ruby performance leaves much to be desired when dealing with concurrency and high-loads.

    Does this mean that we should betray our favorite language, which brings us happiness, in favor of others?

    My answer is NO, and I want to show you, how we can combine the elegance of Ruby with the power of other languages to improve the performance of real-time applications.

    This talk was given at the WNB.rb meetup on September 27, 2022.

    Are you new to unit testing? Maybe you've already written some unit tests and would like to refresh and expand your understanding? Well, you're in luck because this talk is just for you. How can we ensure that the software we build is fit-for-purpose, robust and meets users' needs? Well, that's where software testing comes in handy and even better, automated software testing. In this practical talk, I will demystify what software testing is and the purpose of unit testing. We'll have a look at the unit testing structure and a code example in the RSpec unit testing framework and I'll be sharing some unit testing top tips to help you get the most out of it.By this end of this talk, you'll be able to give software testing a go, start to use it in your learning projects or advocate for it within your teams. It's not as yucky as it sounds; automated testing is a key part of building great software and making your Software Engineering life sweeter!

    Kim Diep is a Software Engineer at Butternut Box and she lives in London, England, UK. By day, she builds software with Ruby code. She also loves building things with the C# programming language, .NET ecosystem and Unity. She only just started Ruby a little over 3 months ago. Before then, she was working primarily in C#. She is passionate about creating things for tech education and loves sharing her experiences with the community to encourage others to learn and grow in their technical skills and confidence. She currently volunteers as a mentor for those who are underrepresented in tech and/or come from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. In Winter 2021, Kim created Curiously Code as a discovery platform providing technology, career and wellbeing inspiration for Curious Humans. By night and on the weekends, you can find Kim practising Kendo, working out at the gym or something random like playing video games and doing some Instax photography!

    Attackers aim to take control of a legitimate RubyGems.org user account, and use

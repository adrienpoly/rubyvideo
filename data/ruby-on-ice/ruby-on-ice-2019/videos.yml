    On August 15, 2018 GitHub accomplished a great feat: upgrading our application from Rails 3.2 to 5.2. While this upgrade took a difficult year and a half your upgrade doesn't need to be this hard. In this talk we'll look at ways in which our upgrade was uniquely hard, how we accomplished this monumental task, and what we're doing to prevent hard upgrades in the future. We'll take a deep dive into why we upgraded Rails and our plans for upstreaming features from the GitHub application into the Rails framework.

    Eileen M. Uchitelle is an Senior Systems Engineer on the Platform Systems Team at GitHub and a member of the Rails Core team. She's an avid contributor to open source focusing on the Ruby on Rails framework and its dependencies. Eileen is passionate about security, performance, and making open source communities more sustainable and welcoming.

    We have the power to stand up against oppression that exists in our software. Data discrimination, biases in algorithms, etc. are becoming an issue. You’ll learn about the biases we build, software that is bettering us and what you can do about it, as a developer, to truly make a difference.

    Kinsey Ann Durham is an engineer at DigitalOcean working remotely in Denver, CO. She teaches students from around the globe how to write code through a program called Bloc. She co-founded a non-profit called Kubmo in 2013 that teaches and builds technology curriculum for women’s empowerment programs around the world. She, also, helps run the Scholar and Guide Program for Ruby Central conferences. In her free time, she enjoys fly fishing and adventuring in the Colorado outdoors with her dog, Harleigh.

  description: |-
    When working on a Rails app with lots of users and a plethora of requests, you’ll likely soon be addressing how you can have dedicated custom hardware for them.
    In this talk, I’ll go over my experiences and lessons learned from working on dedicated hardware for industrial catering services.

    Carmen Huidobro is a chilean kids’ coding instructor and freelance software dev. She likes to introduce people to coding more than she enjoys coding itself. If you want pointless Nintendo trivia, look no further than Carmen! You’ll probably find her at a lot of conferences and has been told she has a distinctive laugh, so she’s easy to spot, especially when wearing a onesie.

    Ever caught yourself dictating code to a junior dev, rather than pairing? Or resorted to saying “best practice”? Kill two birds with one stone: use “dialogic teaching,” an adult-education technique. Let’s turn “technical leadership” into a two-way process that surfaces tradeoffs and gets buy-in.

    Betsy Haibel is the founding CTO of Cohere. She writes fiction and nonfiction in English, Ruby, and Javascript – among other languages – and co-organizes Learn Ruby in DC. Her lifelong ambitions? To meet a red panda, and to break down barriers between “developers” and “users.”

    Have you ever tried to develop front end code that can be easily used in multiple projects? Reinventing the wheel is no fun. In this talk, I will use an example to share my design process for developing web components that are accessible, pretty, and most importantly easy to reuse.

    Joy Heron is a consultant at INNOQ and develops software as a full-stack developer. She is passionate about developing responsive web applications using progressive enhancement and loves learning new things. Sketchnotes are a hobby.

  description: |-
    Array and Hash are used in every Ruby program, but current implementations either prevent to use them in parallel (MRI) or lack thread-safety guarantees (JRuby raises on concurrent Array#«). We show how to make Array and Hash thread-safe while allowing Ruby collections to scale up to tens of cores!

    Benoit Daloze is a PhD student in Linz, Austria, researching concurrency in Ruby with TruffleRuby for the past several years. He has contributed to many Ruby implementations, including TruffleRuby, MRI and JRuby. He is the maintainer of ruby/spec, a test suite for the behavior of the Ruby programming language.

  description: |-
    With more applications now using service-oriented architectures, developers must know how to talk to distributed technologies and to handle errors and failures. While you can usually depend on libraries to encapsulate such details, it's important to understand and to be able to predict the behavior of your distributed systems. This talk will arm you with algorithms and testing strategies so you can tame your services and build robust applications.

    Emily Stolfo works at Elastic where she maintains the Ruby client and the Rails integrations project. She's also an adjunct faculty of Columbia University where she has taught courses on databases and web development. Although originally from New York, she's currently living in Berlin where she likes to run long distances and make sourdough bread.

  description: |-
    Writing performant code is hard. Writing performant ruby code that does lots of stuff is really hard. CocoaPods got to be pretty slow “at scale”, and this is the story of how we made our pod install times bearable again.

    Samuel Giddins is a developer well-versed in the rituals of writing developer tools that occasionally work. By day, Samuel works on making the mobile developer experience at Square less arduous; by night he can be found breaking Bundler and CocoaPods. Before this whole “developer” thing, Samuel studied in the highly impractical Mathematics & Economics departments at UChicago, learning subjects such as “numbers”, “social theory”, and “memes”. When not coding, Samuel is often in the kitchen, marveling at the fact that dinner smells better than it looks.

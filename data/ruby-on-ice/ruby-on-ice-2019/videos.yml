    On August 15, 2018 GitHub accomplished a great feat: upgrading our application from Rails 3.2 to 5.2. While this upgrade took a difficult year and a half your upgrade doesn't need to be this hard. In this talk we'll look at ways in which our upgrade was uniquely hard, how we accomplished this monumental task, and what we're doing to prevent hard upgrades in the future. We'll take a deep dive into why we upgraded Rails and our plans for upstreaming features from the GitHub application into the Rails framework.

    We have the power to stand up against oppression that exists in our software. Data discrimination, biases in algorithms, etc. are becoming an issue. You’ll learn about the biases we build, software that is bettering us and what you can do about it, as a developer, to truly make a difference.

    When working on a Rails app with lots of users and a plethora of requests, you’ll likely soon be addressing how you can have dedicated custom hardware for them.

    In this talk, I’ll go over my experiences and lessons learned from working on dedicated hardware for industrial catering services.

    Ever caught yourself dictating code to a junior dev, rather than pairing? Or resorted to saying “best practice”? Kill two birds with one stone: use “dialogic teaching,” an adult-education technique. Let’s turn “technical leadership” into a two-way process that surfaces tradeoffs and gets buy-in.

    Array and Hash are used in every Ruby program, but current implementations either prevent to use them in parallel (MRI) or lack thread-safety guarantees (JRuby raises on concurrent Array#«). We show how to make Array and Hash thread-safe while allowing Ruby collections to scale up to tens of cores!

    With more applications now using service-oriented architectures, developers must know how to talk to distributed technologies and to handle errors and failures. While you can usually depend on libraries to encapsulate such details, it's important to understand and to be able to predict the behavior of your distributed systems. This talk will arm you with algorithms and testing strategies so you can tame your services and build robust applications.

    Writing performant code is hard. Writing performant ruby code that does lots of stuff is really hard. CocoaPods got to be pretty slow “at scale”, and this is the story of how we made our pod install times bearable again.

    Samuel Giddins is a developer well-versed in the rituals of writing developer tools that occasionally work. By day, Samuel works on making the mobile developer experience at Square less arduous; by night he can be found breaking Bundler and CocoaPods. Before this whole “developer” thing, Samuel studied in the highly impractical Mathematics & Economics departments at UChicago, learning subjects such as “numbers”, “social theory”, and “memes”. When not coding, Samuel is often in the kitchen, marveling at the fact that dinner smells better than it looks.

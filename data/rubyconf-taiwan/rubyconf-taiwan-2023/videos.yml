    A Rails performance guidebook: from 0 to 1B requests/day

    Building a feature is not good enough anymore: all your work won't be of use if it's not performant enough. So how to improve performance? After all, performance is not an easy discipline to master: all slow applications are slow in their own way, meaning that there is no silver bullet for these kinds of problems.

    In this presentation, we will guide you across patterns, strategies, and little tricks to improve performance. We will do that by sharing real stories of our daily experience facing and solving real performance issues in an application that daily serves billions of requests per day.

Major version upgrade of the OpenSSL backend? There is a deep dungeon behind one of Ruby's default gem, and I will talk about one adventure through this dungeon.

    Developing cross-platform mruby software for Dreamcast and Wii

    With mruby, we can write Ruby for many environments including old video game consoles. I am working on a cross-platform library for mruby so software written for mruby on Dreamcast can be run on Wii with little change to the source. I have ported the block puzzle I showed at RubyConfTW 2019 to Wii, and am now working on the presentation tool.

    I will tell you about what is involved in making a cross-platform mruby library for Dreamcast and Wii, as well as challenges and lessons learned.

    This presentation will (hopefully) be delivered on either of those consoles and will include some live demos.

    High Speed Parsing Massive XML Data in Ruby

    A massive XML called BioProject has been published. However, when I parsed the XML as it was, rexml got freeze somewhere, and nokogiri ended up consuming a large amount of memory and being slow. Looking at the sample implementation in Python, it uses iterparse() to parse each element in the first layer. Therefore, we created a similar mechanism in Ruby and also used ractor to speed it up.

    Refining Fork Management: From Workarounds to `Process#_fork`

    With the release of Ruby 3.1 in 2021, an enhancement arrived as Process#_fork, allowing us to override the fork method. This addition simplifies creating callbacks when forking. While there was no official method to track fork events prior to Ruby 3.1, this limitation didn't deter the community from exploring various approaches to achieve the same goal.

    In the past, Rails encouraged the use of before_fork and after_fork for connection management, redis-rb ensured fork safety by storing the Process#pid in a variable, and some even used threads to track fork events.

    During this session, I will delve into the backstory of _fork and explore the diverse methods the community employed for creating callbacks during forking prior to Ruby 3.1.

    The Large-Language Models have taken application development by storm. Ruby has libraries that help build LLM applications, e.g.: Langchain.rb. We need to understand what kind of LLM applications can be built, how to build them, and what are common pitfalls when building them. We're going to look at building vector (semantic) search, chat bots and business process automation solutions. We're going to learn AI/LLM-related concepts, terms and ideas, learn what AI agents are, and look at some of the latest cutting edge AI research.

    Monadic Approach to Ruby Error Handling

    Error handling is an essential part of software development. No matter how well-written your code is, there will always be errors. The key is to handle them in a way that minimizes their impact.

    In this talk, we will build a foundation of error handling concepts, categorizing errors and exceptions in Ruby. We'll look at practical code examples that demonstrate common issues when propagating errors through layers of code. Explore how Monadic Handling abstract away error handling details by combine Monads Result and Service Object in Ruby programming.

    This talk will empower you understand how to use Monadic Handling Ruby code. You'll leave with a deeper appreciation of monads and concrete strategies for encapsulating errors elegantly in your Ruby applications. Join me to discover how monads enable you to minimize disruption and maximize control over error handling in Ruby.

    In this talk, we redefine the emerging role of Generative AI Engineer. Beyond just the LLM itself, developing AI applications presents many challenges and tasks. Now software developers can build AI apps by using LLM APIs and don’t have to start learning machine learning from the beginning. We can focus on Prompt Engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG), Vector Search, Agents, and OpenAI Function Calling. Join us in exploring the role of AI engineers in this new era.

    Nadia Odunayo has been so often the smiling face on the door of this event, but did you know she‚Äôs the founder and (more impressively!) one woman development team behind The StoryGraph, a reading community of over a million book lovers. Her story is one of grit, insight and technical insights into what it takes to execute on the ‚Äúone person framework‚Äù.

    Nadia Odunayo is the founder and CEO of The StoryGraph, the app that helps you to track your reading and choose which book to read next based on your mood and favorite topics and themes. She previously worked at Pivotal Labs as a software engineer and originally learnt to code at Makers Academy in London. In her spare time she loves to take dance class and, naturally, read!

    Making mistakes is one way to learn. But no matter how many times someone says that to me, it still feels bad when it happens. This talk shares some ways to help you make fewer mistakes by making better decisions.

    But there are tools and frameworks that you can use to sense-check when you‚Äôre about to make a difficult choice, to help you have the best possible outcome (or to learn better from a choice that in hindsight you think was wrong).

    This talk is aimed at engineers, tech leads, managers, humans - anyone who makes decisions. Making better decisions is a skill that you can improve on, and this talk will introduce some ways to do that.

    Nicky is a Principal Technologist at dxw, providing technical leadership and support to the Technology Team and dxw‚Äôs clients. She has spent more than two decades as a freelance and in-house developer, delivering successful projects for clients ranging from global banks and major publishing houses to indie storytelling agencies. She‚Äôs worked with designers all over the world, making beautiful websites that work for everyone. Offline, Nicky enjoys watching bad TV and learning new stuff: this year it‚Äôs a serious sewing/dressmaking habit.

    What do you do if something goes wrong with your database? Maybe your queries are running slowly, you‚Äôre getting a weird error, or an important table seems to have disappeared. If you don‚Äôt have the luxury of a dedicated DBA, you‚Äôll probably need to figure out what‚Äôs going wrong and fix it yourself. Let‚Äôs look at some common database issues and give you the tools you need to investigate and fix them.

    Implementing a feature like ‚Äúnotifications‚Äù in an app sounds simple, right? As you dig in to problems like this, you‚Äôll realize the complexity that lies below the surface.

    In this talk, we‚Äôll walk through designing a feature like Notifications and how naming, DSLs, metaprogramming, and a bunch of other small decisions can make code feel delightful to use. Plus, we‚Äôll take a look at some of the decisions along the way that didn‚Äôt turn out so well, analyze why they didn‚Äôt work, and how we can improve them.

    Lots of people in Ruby community choose RSpec as the default without really considering its drawbacks. I feel like not much is being done to popularise other test frameworks. Cleo is a fairly successful project that has used Minitest since its inception in 2016, and I would love to share this success story from a perspective of someone who hadn‚Äôt professionally worked with Minitest before joining Cleo.

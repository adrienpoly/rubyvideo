  description: "Being an open source contributor requires many resources
    we often take for granted: technical knowledge, confidence in that knowledge,
    access to technical tools, and a socioeconomic status that allows us to code without
    financial compensation. These resources are inaccessible to many, if not most.\n\nShifting
    the face of our community to better represent our increasingly global user base
    requires us to examine what groups are least likely to have access to these resources
    and how different organizations and initiatives are working to remove these barriers
    and create entry points for groups of people who face the biggest obstacles in
    their journey to becoming creators in our community.\n\n\n      Formerly an apprentice
    herself, she started the CodeNewbie movement: the most supportive community of
    programmers and people learning to code. Saron will bring her perspective to share
    ideas for learners and coaches."

  description: "“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world”,
    said Wittgenstein.\n\nIn human-to-human languages the same core ideas get shaped
    differently depending on the language in which they are spoken. What if every
    computational language engenders a set (or a subset) of culture and values, and
    as a consequence attracts and shapes a corresponding community?\n\nWhat are the
    values that entered into the language by way of its core committers and what are
    the values we identify with as a community. How can making these values explicit
    help us foster a better community?\n\n\n      CTO of education startup Skive and
    very active in the Ruby community, having founded the annual eurucamp camp/conference
    and JRubyConf EU.\\n\\nHe has also contributed extensively to many open-source

    How did it make you feel? Why did it make you feel that way?\n\nChances are you
    answered those two questions poorly. Our inability to answer such questions effectively
    leads us to communicate in ways that are negative and unhelpful.\n\nLet’s explore
    a day in the life of a fictional programmer who, just like us, means well and
    wants to do a great job. We’ll use our protagonist’s story to learn about how
    to honestly express our needs and effectively collaborate in disagreement."

    interior designers to put furniture, rugs, etc. into the space, so people can
    imagine themselves there, and it's not just empty.\n\nStaged houses are beautiful.
    They're designed to make you go \"WOW\" when you walk in, and think, \"I could
    live like this.\"\n\nBut you can’t actually live in a staged house. They leave
    out lots of things that make a space more cluttered, but also make it work.\n\n\n

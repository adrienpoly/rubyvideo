    Every human can get trapped in cycles of bad communication, that’s very true of developers. Join me for appalling Yorkshire accents, drama triangles and wittily-named psychological theories.

    Why build a super-fast code-formatter for Ruby given there is no written standard for how Ruby is supposed to work?

    Emma wants to explain how trivial your work is, nowadays. After all, there are so many gems, libraries and frameworks that make your work as developers painfully simple, really obvious and frighteningly easy. All you have to do is just use them: they make programming painless!

    Except she won’t. Expanding on her justsimply.dev manifesto, Emma will share some of the most egregious examples of technical documentation that infuriate rather than help. And she’ll provide useful advice to keep your technical writing friendly, supportive and impactful.

    And yes. All the phrases in the first paragraph are from real world documentation. By the end of this talk you’ll have resolved not to put people off using the code you’ve worked so hard to create. Because if someone’s having to read your docs, it’s not “simple”.

    Book publisher turned programmer. She runs generalproducts.co, makers of Consonance, as well as indie publisher Snowbooks, and she maintains schools publishing app Make Our Book on Side Project Fridays. She works in a first floor office in a market town in the Oxfordshire countryside, which attracts a local cat that visits through the window.

    A new talk, based on an old one - planning for personal sparkles: A COVID-19 plan.

    Before we talked about maximizing your work day but in today’s world, Allison has re-done the talk to focus on how to take advantage of the bits and bursts of focus you may get in a day.

    There’s a lot going on in the world and hopefully this talk helps.

  description: |-
    Engineering managers are, almost by definition, highly capable and strongly driven individuals. These traits are indispensable to success in leading software engineering teams, but they are also the very traits that make engineering managers susceptible to burn out. People who can get things done often find themselves overwhelmed by their to-do lists.

    This talk will combine the understanding from the trenches of Anjuan Simmons (who has been an engineering manager for more than 20 years) with the academic understanding of his wife, Dr. Aneika Simmons. Together, they will provide a framework for reducing burnout and consistently keeping stress levels in a managed state.

    We’ll look at the philosophy behind the framework as well as the overall structure of the components and explore some of the common patterns that Rails uses to build agnostic and beautiful interfaces, and the techniques it implements to hide complexity so you can focus on building your application.

    By the end of this talk you’ll be more confident navigating the Rails codebase and better understand the patterns it uses to create the framework we all know and love. But Rails is so much more than its design and architecture. We’ll dive into my motivations for working on the framework and why the community is so important to the long term success of Rails.

    Why the Lucky Stiff, one of the most beloved members of the historical Ruby community, is widely known for his seminal Poignant Guide to Ruby. His second-most ambitious writing, NOBODY KNOWS SHOES, is lesser-known. This text was the manual for an amazing set of tools _why developed in 2007 called Shoes.rb.

    With pure Ruby, married with _why’s supreme taste in APIs, one could easily write desktop applications and package them for Mac, Windows or Linux. In 2007! Imagine writing useful native applications and sharing them with your friend who didn’t have Ruby on their machine nor any technical knowledge. Dear reader, your speaker in fact used Shoes.rb to build Desktop apps before using Rails to write Webapps.

    Over the years, Shoes has fought off the endless wave of bitrot. An effort to rewrite Shoes in JRuby stalled in 2017. Existing Shoes is difficult, likely impossible, to run.

    Nick will walk you through Shoes history; and cover his work on a new Shoes.rb implementation to bring Shoes back to life on modern tooling with Scarpe. (Italian for “Shoes”)

    I’ve been working with Ruby since the early 2000s. Ruby has changed a lot in that time, but we don’t always remember how much. Let’s rewrite a short program so that it runs in a twenty-year-old version of Ruby and see how much syntax and performance has changed for the better in twenty years.

    Ruby is being actively developed, and getting better over time, but even when it was more limited and slower it was still a viable language for development.

    There is always room for improvement. Let this talk illuminate newer programmers and remind grizzled veterans. Be grateful for those who have got us here and optimistic about using Ruby in the future.

    When people think of usability improvements, they often think of the front end. But when you really understand your domain, using the power of the back end can be the best way to save your users’ time.

    A book app is often a starter example for learning to code. Using an example audiobook, I show how quickly a basic book record becomes complex.

    A side quest to explain Ranganathan’s five laws of library science and how well they translate to building web apps (particularly law 4 - “Save the time of the ~~reader~~ user”).

    You want to enforce a standard in your codebase, like making sure a company name is in title case. So you add “always check for correct capitalisation” to your pull request guidelines. Over time, people forget to check and mistakes sneak in.

    But wait - there’s an easier way! I’ll show you how you can write a custom Rubocop rule to check for you. So if someone breaks the rule, your CI tooling will flag it up so they can fix it, freeing you up to focus on more important things.

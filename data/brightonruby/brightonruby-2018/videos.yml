  description:
    "At the beginning of 2018's Brighton Ruby, during the introduction,
    I wanted to 'get into' what having a Code of Conduct means. I hadn't seen anyone
    do this, and it's a topic I'd been thinking about a lot this year.\n\nIt's important
    to be introspective, as an organiser, about the impact of your event and your
    own responsibility to include people into our communities. We all have responsibilities
    and expectations about our behaviour toward each other, this is my take on what
    it means, for Brighton Ruby at least.\n\nI don't think I did a brilliant job,
    it's difficult to be clear, and I still have my blind spots.\n\nHowever, the amount
    of positive feedback I've had about this 'impromptu lightning talk' indicated
    that I should share this and encourage other organisers to think about what they
    are doing to make sure that they are making the Code of Conduct a living thing
    and to ensure they are hearing about the stuff that people might otherwise ignore."

  description: "As novices we slowly and laboriously sift through a chaotic
    flood of\nminutia. To experts the significant details are obvious. Irrelevant\ndetails
    fade to the background. The novice receives a jumble of\nmeaningless impressions;
    the expert sees patterns and meaning.\n\nSomehow experts have made the trek from
    \"How could you possibly tell?\"\nto \"How could you not?\". And they probably
    can't tell you how they got\nthere.\n\nThis talk examines the topic of perceptual
    learning through the lens\nof theory and practice—research and anecdotes—and speculates
    how it\ncan be deployed strategically to train new experts.\n\n\n      An ecosystem

  description: "Often we know that our code needs refactoring, but we
    have no idea where to start. Maybe we studied some common code smells and learned
    about the things that we should be avoiding, but memorizing the rules doesn’t
    automatically lead to fixing all problems.\n\nIn this talk, we explore how you
    can use Git to recognize and address violations to each of the SOLID principles.
    Using diffs, commit history and pull requests you can learn to recognize patterns
    in code that point to problems. These same tools can help you correct those issues
    and write more maintainable code.\n\n\n      Ashley lives in Durham, NC and is
    an Application Engineer at GitHub. She enjoys helping others learn to code and

    that was not that great. Even the code that was pretty good at one point, could
    now be improved, due to the evolution of Ruby.\n\nLet us refactor some code in
    long-lived Ruby and Rails open source projects and what can we learn while doing
    it.\n\n\n      Ana is in love the open source development. She is currently working

    a long and painful journey trying to understand the obscure intent of a line of
    code. The only difference between these two realities? The revision history.\n\nThis
    is a talk about writing maintainable code. But rather than the code itself, we'll
    see the impact a codebase's history can have on its maintainability. We'll explore
    the differences between a useful history and an unhelpful one, and you'll learn
    about the practices, tools and techniques that can make the difference.\n\n\n

    that supports them.\n\n\n      VP of Engineering at Edinburgh-based FreeAgent.

    regularly as time zones and daylight savings rules change more often than you
    might think!\n\nBy building a project configuration first, rather than focussing
    on one programming language, you can get a much wider range of people contributing
    to your open source package. We built a Ruby gem for public holidays that covered
    71 countries. By converting it to a configuration first project we were able to
    release packages for Ruby, Node.js and Perl so that more people could use the
    data and we’d be more likely to get patches and bug fixes.\n\n\n      Senior software

    "[Event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)
    is a design pattern to help build applications that are focused on the domain
    and easy to extend.\n\nThe key idea is to use a persistent event log to store
    every change to your data as an alternative the more classical relational database
    model for Rails applications. In one sentence, it is a git-like approach to manage
    your data.\n\nOnce you accept the premise of having an event log you can use it
    to extend your application in all sort of creative ways. You can use it to synchronize
    the data between your microservices, or you can trigger side effects without cluttering
    your controllers, or you can build data views optimized for your query needs.\n\n\n

  description: "At the beginning of 2018's Brighton Ruby, during the introduction, I wanted to 'get into' what having a Code of Conduct means. I hadn't seen anyone do this, and it's a topic I'd been thinking about a lot this year.\n\nIt's important to be introspective, as an organiser, about the impact of your event and your own responsibility to include people into our communities. We all have responsibilities and expectations about our behaviour toward each other, this is my take on what it means, for Brighton Ruby at least.\n\nI don't think I did a brilliant job, it's difficult to be clear, and I still have my blind spots.\n\nHowever, the amount of positive feedback I've had about this 'impromptu lightning talk' indicated that I should share this and encourage other organisers to think about what they are doing to make sure that they are making the Code of Conduct a living thing and to ensure they are hearing about the stuff that people might otherwise ignore."

  description: "As novices we slowly and laboriously sift through a chaotic flood of\nminutia. To experts the significant details are obvious. Irrelevant\ndetails fade to the background. The novice receives a jumble of\nmeaningless impressions; the expert sees patterns and meaning.\n\nSomehow experts have made the trek from \"How could you possibly tell?\"\nto \"How could you not?\". And they probably can't tell you how they got\nthere.\n\nThis talk examines the topic of perceptual learning through the lens\nof theory and practice—research and anecdotes—and speculates how it\ncan be deployed strategically to train new experts.\n\n\n      An ecosystem engineer at GitHub and author. She accidentally became a developer while pursuing a degree in molecular author_biologymarkdown. When programming, her focus is on automation, workflow optimization, and refactoring."

  description: "Often we know that our code needs refactoring, but we have no idea where to start. Maybe we studied some common code smells and learned about the things that we should be avoiding, but memorizing the rules doesn’t automatically lead to fixing all problems.\n\nIn this talk, we explore how you can use Git to recognize and address violations to each of the SOLID principles. Using diffs, commit history and pull requests you can learn to recognize patterns in code that point to problems. These same tools can help you correct those issues and write more maintainable code.\n\n\n      Ashley lives in Durham, NC and is an Application Engineer at GitHub. She enjoys helping others learn to code and is the lead organizer for RailsBridge Triangle and a mentor for Code the Dream"

  description: "This year both Ruby and I are turning 25 years old. We all also have to admit that at some point we have found, or written, Ruby code that was not that great. Even the code that was pretty good at one point, could now be improved, due to the evolution of Ruby.\n\nLet us refactor some code in long-lived Ruby and Rails open source projects and what can we learn while doing it.\n\n\n      Ana is in love the open source development. She is currently working at SUSE on the Open Build Service frontend, one of the oldest Rails projects that is still in use."

  description: "In one timeline a quick path to clarity. In the other a long and painful journey trying to understand the obscure intent of a line of code. The only difference between these two realities? The revision history.\n\nThis is a talk about writing maintainable code. But rather than the code itself, we'll see the impact a codebase's history can have on its maintainability. We'll explore the differences between a useful history and an unhelpful one, and you'll learn about the practices, tools and techniques that can make the difference.\n\n\n      Tekin Süleyman is a freelance consultant who's been shipping Ruby code for over a decade. He's worked with teams, large and small. He also runs the North West Ruby User Group in Manchester."

Being successful requires changes to work practices, communication, and style — and not just from the remote people. Everyone will experience changes. It helps to be prepared … and most of what we see being written and discussed is focused on remote workers, not the organization that supports them.\n\n\n      VP of Engineering at Edinburgh-based FreeAgent.

  description: "You might not realise it, but your Ruby project probably relies on a popular configuration-first OSS project. The `tzdata` library is updated regularly as time zones and daylight savings rules change more often than you might think!\n\nBy building a project configuration first, rather than focussing on one programming language, you can get a much wider range of people contributing to your open source package. We built a Ruby gem for public holidays that covered 71 countries. By converting it to a configuration first project we were able to release packages for Ruby, Node.js and Perl so that more people could use the data and we’d be more likely to get patches and bug fixes.\n\n\n \     Senior software engineer at CharlieHR, building the HR software for teams with big ideas. Previously CTO at Nestoria so ask me about writing Perl for a decade before switching to Ruby :-)"

  description: "[Event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) is a design pattern to help build applications that are focused on the domain and easy to extend.\n\nThe key idea is to use a persistent event log to store every change to your data as an alternative the more classical relational database model for Rails applications. In one sentence, it is a git-like approach to manage your data.\n\nOnce you accept the premise of having an event log you can use it to extend your application in all sort of creative ways. You can use it to synchronize the data between your microservices, or you can trigger side effects without cluttering your controllers, or you can build data views optimized for your query needs.\n\n\n      CTO at CreditSpring, protecting people from unexpected financial emergencies. Loves data and scientific experimentation over intuition and learning over being too serious."

They challenge you to think about cryptography, security, and teach you the motions of how to encrypt, decrypt, and attack.\n\nIt’s not wildly complex, it’s not a set of logic systems above everything you already know if you can put together FizzBuzz. As an apprentice, a key part of my job is to learn - Cryptopals, regardless of your own expertise, is one of the most rewarding ways to learn Ruby, to learn logic, and to learn how all the encryption you rely on works.\n\n\n \     Hannah Dwan is a developer at Happy Bear Software!

  description: "The average salary for a Ruby programmer (according to Techworld) is £52k, but the average net worth of a “J. K. Rowling” is more than $1bn! Clearly we’re in the wrong business; we shouldn’t be writing Ruby code, we should be writing Harry Potter books.\n\nThe bad news is that writing novels beloved by children across the world is hard. The good news is we can get Ruby to do it for us! It turns out that Ruby and the dark arts of NLP (Natural Language Programming) are a match made in heaven.\n\nUsing some basic language modeling techniques, a dash of probability, and a few lines of easy-to-follow Ruby code, we can create a virtual author capable of generating a very convincing Potter pastiche. And if the life of an author’s not for you, don’t worry. The techniques we’ll explore are applicable to a host of other problems, from machine translation to spam detection.\n\n\n      Alex is the co-founder and CTO of Peg, a technology platform helping multinational brands and agencies to find and work with top YouTubers."

  description: "The Internet is built on technology that was never meant
    to work together. Basic features in seemingly simple and innocuous technologies,
    such as XML, resulted in these technologies being insecure.\n\nIn this session
    we’ll talk about how attackers exploit well known vulnerabilities like XSS, XXE,
    and CSRF and how to make more secure software by avoiding similar decisions that
    resulted in these exploits.\n\n\n      Staff Engineer on the Ruby Architecture
    Team at GitHub and a member of the Rails Core team. She’s an avid contributor
    to open source focusing on the Ruby on Rails framework and its dependencies. Eileen
    is passionate about scalability, performance, and making open source communities
    more sustainable and welcoming."

  description: "Objects are abstractions and we should be suspicious of
    them. Not only are abstractions hard, but bad abstractions are harmful to programming.
    So why use objects? Why not just stick to the simpler and more natural world of
    procedural programming?\n\nIn this talk we take some real world ruby code written
    in a procedural style and refactor it to an Object Oriented style. Along the way
    we’ll see how this changes the we think about programming, and how this gives
    us better tools for tackling the inevitable complexity that will creep into your
    project."

  description: "Sometimes, writing Rails apps is awful. Do you know what’s
    nearly always more awful? Hand-rolling assembly. Ruby lets us not think about
    how the processor works, but we’re programmers. We’re uniquely positioned to intellectually
    appreciate the wonderful, complex, engineering that goes into a processor.\n\nIn
    this talk, you’ll learn a little more about what it means for Ruby to be an “interpreted”
    language, how a processor executes programs, and what magical tricks processor
    designers use to make our programs go faster with every generation. If you’ve
    ever written a Ruby program, and understand that a computer has a processor in
    it, this talk is probably for you."

  description: "This is a talk about the process and product of code.
    It’s a talk about the open source community, about maintenance and tests. About
    starting projects from existing repositories, using existing APIs, and copy/pasting
    existing lines of code as that big, scary word we call plagiarism looms over a
    21st century newsroom.\n\nIt’s a talk about building something the right way under
    deadline. About humans who write algorithms that determine the news. It’s about
    bias and about the function it serves. About the privileges and perspectives that
    programmers bring to their code and about the privileges and perspectives that
    journalists bring to their stories.\n\nPrefer to read, rather than watch? [The
    Function of Bias](https://medium.com/@sarambsimon/the-function-of-bias-b92fc968fac1#.c5ch46ws3)"

  description: "The drivers team at MongoDB focused over the last year
    on conforming to common APIs and algorithms but we needed a shared way to test
    our 9 drivers. We therefore ended up building our own testing DSL, REST service,
    and individual test frameworks to validate our consistency.\n\nUsing these common
    tests and the Ruby driver’s test suite as examples, this talk shows you how they
    designed and built a custom testing framework and perhaps tempt you to do the
    same."

  description: "We love Ruby but it has it’s problems. Concurrency, performance,
    fault tolerant being some of them. Elixir is a functional language built on the
    Erlang VM which is now around 30 years old. It was built to solve these problems
    for telephone networks.\n\nWhen was the last time your phone network went down
    for “Scheduled Maintenance” or went down due to issues? I certainly can’t remember
    a single occasion. With Elixir we now have an expressive language like we have
    with Ruby but now with the power of the Erlang VM. This talk will show you a super
    brief look at Elixir with the hope that you might give it a try.\n\nContains mad
    rhymes."

    WebSockets or Turbolinks.\n\nA deep look at several of the “minor” features of
    Rails 5. You won’t just learn about the features, but you’ll learn about why they
    were added, the reasoning behind them, and the difficulties of adding them from
    someone directly involved in many of them."

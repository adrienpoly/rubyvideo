    A year ago I was looking for a job, and ended up taking a job as a “Technical Architect”.

    But what exactly is a Technical Architect?

    Weren’t Software Architects a thing in the 90s, cast away when we learnt about Agile?

    In this talk I’m going to tell the story of my year in government as a Technical Architect, and hopefully convince you that there is a place for just enough architecture in modern software development.

    And maybe it’s a role you’d be interested in

    This is the story of how I struggled to get my first Junior Developer role and turned to Open Source projects looking for help. We’ll learn how the best GitHub repos are attracting new contributors, why developers early in their coding journey can struggle to get to grips with a new repo and how you avoid these stumbling blocks to create a vibrant open source project.

    We all know that testing is important. But it’s also hard to get right. We’ll talk about how to write effective tests that not only protect against defects in our code, but encourage us to write better quality code to begin with.

    You’ll leave this talk with ideas on the philosophies that should inform your tests, and a good idea of what makes a good test suite.

          Valerie loves writing software, running marathons, and baking desserts.

    As developers, we talk a lot about the topic of clean code. We aspire for 100% test coverage, short reusable methods, we optimise for readability and beauty - but does any of that actually matter if your codebase is drowning in technical debt?

    Should we be aiming for clean code, or tidy code? In this talk, you may discover that you are in fact a closet code slob, contributing to the clutter of your codebase every single day.

    But fear not, because tidying a codebase is as simple as decluttering your home. Drawing on lots of practical examples, this talk will arm you with some simple techniques to permanently purge technical debt and be free from code-clutter forever.

          Sroop Sunar is a Software Developer (and employee #1) at Peg. Before that, she worked at Thoughtbot, and in a previous life was an illustrator and graphic designer.

    Ruby keeps getting faster. And people keep asking, “but how fast is it for Rails?” Rails makes a great way to measure Ruby’s speed, and how Ruby has changed version-by-version. Let’s look at six years of performance for apps big and small.

    How fast is 2.6.0? With JIT or not? How do I measure? How close is Ruby 3x3? Should I upgrade?

          Noah is a Ruby Fellow for AppFolio, working on the core Ruby language and related tooling. After over 30 years of communicating with computers, Noah now believes that communicating with humans may not be a passing fad, and he’s trying it out.

    People sometimes say “it’s never a compiler error”. They don’t mean it literally — what they mean is that it’s very tempting to blame the compiler or interpreter for a bug that is actually in our own code. But sometimes, when the stars align, there it is. The mythical interpreter bug.

    I’m going to show you how I narrowed down from “the website is crashing on my computer” to a real, live bug in the Ruby interpreter. We’ll look at how we can use techniques we already know, like unit testing and git, in the unfamiliar context of Ruby’s C internals. And, when we’ve finally figured out what’s causing our bug, we’ll go through the bug reporting process and learn how to share our findings and help make Ruby better for everyone.

    Cast your mind back to the year 1995. Gansta’s Paradise is the top hit of the year. Friends is the hottest show on TV.

    And just days after I turn nine, Matz releases Ruby publicly for the first time.

    In this talk I go back to Ruby 0.95 and see what it takes to get it running on modern hardware.

    It’s been said that programmers like garbage collectors, so let’s take a look at Ruby’s GC! In this talk we'll walk through how Ruby allocates objects, then talk about how we can optimize object layout and memory usage via compaction. Finally we’ll take a look at how to actually build a compacting GC for Ruby as well as the interesting challenges that can be found within.

          Aaron is on the Ruby core team, the Rails core team, and the team that takes care of his cat, Gorby puff.  During the day he works for a small technology company called GitHub.  Someday he will find the perfect safety gear to wear while extreme programming.

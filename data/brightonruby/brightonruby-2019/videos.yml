  description: "A year ago I was looking for a job, and ended up taking
    a job as a “Technical Architect”.\n\nBut what exactly is a Technical Architect?\n\nWeren’t
    Software Architects a thing in the 90s, cast away when we learnt about Agile?\n\nIn
    this talk I’m going to tell the story of my year in government as a Technical
    Architect, and hopefully convince you that there is a place for just enough architecture
    in modern software development.\n\nAnd maybe it’s a role you’d be interested in\n\n\n

  description: "As developers, we talk a lot about the topic of clean
    code. We aspire for 100% test coverage, short reusable methods, we optimise for
    readability and beauty - but does any of that actually matter if your codebase
    is drowning in technical debt?\n\nShould we be aiming for clean code, or tidy
    code? In this talk, you may discover that you are in fact a closet code slob,
    contributing to the clutter of your codebase every single day.\n\nBut fear not,
    because tidying a codebase is as simple as decluttering your home. Drawing on
    lots of practical examples, this talk will arm you with some simple techniques
    to permanently purge technical debt and be free from code-clutter forever.\n\n\n

  description: "Ruby keeps getting faster. And people keep asking, “but
    how fast is it for Rails?” Rails makes a great way to measure Ruby’s speed, and
    how Ruby has changed version-by-version. Let’s look at six years of performance
    for apps big and small.\n\nHow fast is 2.6.0? With JIT or not? How do I measure?
    How close is Ruby 3x3? Should I upgrade?\n\n\n      Noah is a Ruby Fellow for
    AppFolio, working on the core Ruby language and related tooling. After over 30
    years of communicating with computers, Noah now believes that communicating with
    humans may not be a passing fad, and he’s trying it out."

  description: "People sometimes say “it’s never a compiler error”. They
    don’t mean it literally — what they mean is that it’s very tempting to blame the
    compiler or interpreter for a bug that is actually in our own code. But sometimes,
    when the stars align, there it is. The mythical interpreter bug.\n\nI’m going
    to show you how I narrowed down from “the website is crashing on my computer”
    to a real, live bug in the Ruby interpreter. We’ll look at how we can use techniques
    we already know, like unit testing and git, in the unfamiliar context of Ruby’s
    C internals. And, when we’ve finally figured out what’s causing our bug, we’ll
    go through the bug reporting process and learn how to share our findings and help
    make Ruby better for everyone.\n\n\n      A free software developer on the Developer

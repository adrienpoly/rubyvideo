    I've been messing about a little recently with Service Workers & Rails, the end result is you can have your app enter a "read-only" mode when the user goes offline (e.g. they lose network coverage). The cool thing, is it'll work without requiring converting to an SPA, so you can do when you're setup using Server Side Rendering (e.g. turbolinks + ERB templates).

    The main gist of the talk will be use webpacker-pwa & Workbox, or if you're using sprokets serviceworker-rails.

  description: |-
    In this talk, I discuss communication, specifically technical writing, why it's important, and how to improve your skills. Emphasis is on identifying and empathising with your audience. The talk does not strictly cover the writing process as it is taught in schools, but rather focusses on orienting oneself towards readers' needs when writing technical documents or producing other technical writing. The information in this talk is applicable to any kind of technical writing, from commit messages to requests for comment (RFCs), as well as technical writing that is not strictly a part of a technical document (e.g., writing in an email to stakeholders about the status of development on a project).


    Why It's Important

    Bad technical writing is a huge waste of time. Every developer who's worked in the industry for any length of time has encountered vague and unhelpful documentation and seen how much time they spend trying to find information that should've been in the docs in the first place. Engineers who read RFCs and other longer-form documents may notice these documents often don't give adequate context or define terms, leading to more time spent on research rather than focussing on the tasks at hand.

    Dan Moore takes us through JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JWTs are portable, stateless identifiers. They are often used to control access to APIs, but can be used in other contexts as well. The problem they solve is how to share identity details in a scalable, secure way.

    In this talk, Dan will dive deep into that problem, as well as how JWTs should be used, both in generation and in consumption. He'll also cover what kind of signing algorithms are available, when you should avoid a JWT and how to revoke them. He'll also include working code samples showing how to generate or consume JWTs as well as some common Ruby libraries that can be used.

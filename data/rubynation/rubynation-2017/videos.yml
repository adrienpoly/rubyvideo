    Let's Get Creative with Arguments by Polly Schandorf\n\nWould you
    like better error messages? Or methods that are clearer to the caller. How about
    more flexibility ? Most of us have a preference for parameters, but sometimes
    there are better options in certain circumstances. We’ll look at keyword arguments,
    option hashes, splats and destructuring. \n\nIn her previous life, Polly was a
    teacher of elementary through high school students. After being introduced to
    coding using a Rasberry Pi in a teacher workshop - she was hooked, and never looked
    back. She is totally fascinated with fermented foods and makes her own Kombucha,
    Kefir and Red Wine Vinegar.

    What if Shakespeare Wrote Ruby?

    Did you know that Shakespeare wrote almost no direction into his plays? No fight direction. No staging. No notes to the songs. Of the 1700 words he created, there was no official dictionary. That’s right the author of some of the greatest literary works in history, which were filled with situational complexity, fight sequences and music, include NO documentation! How did he do it?

    In this talk, we’re going “thee and thou.” I’m going to give you a crash course in how: Shakespeare writes software.

    Adam Cuppy is: Master of Smile Generation. Ambassador of Company Culture. Tech Entreprenur. Speaker/Educator. One-time Professional Actor @osfashland. Husband. Chief Zealous Officer @CodingZeal.

    A Rubyist Takes a Look at Crystal by David Bock

    Ruby syntax? Compiled? With strong typing? 2x4 times the performance? As an educator, I teach a lot of cool algorithmic stuff. As a rubyist, I want the syntax I know and love. As a computer scientist, this creates a tension over algorithmic performance. So I took a look at crystal and liked what I saw. Will you?

    David Bock turned to programming Ruby full time in 2006, after an upstanding career using Java in the Federal Contracting space, and he has never looked back. He is now corrupting the minds of our youth by posing at a "Teacher’s Assistant" for a java-based high school curriculum, only to expose teenagers to Ruby and tempt them with the Dark Side of the Force. Dave is also the director of the Loudoun Computer Science Initiative.

    Crescent Wrenches and Debuggers: Building Your Own Toolkit For Rational Inquiry by Kerri Miller

    Software exists in a constant state of failure, facing pressure on many fronts - malicious intruders, hapless users, accidental features, and our own limits of imagination all conspire to bring our system to a screeching halt. Untangle even the most tangled of Gordian Knots by building your own toolkit for inquiry, by relying on the simplest technique of all: asking “why?”

    This presentation will discuss the challenges and potential solutions for refreshing multiple application environments (Development/Staging/UAT/etc.) with data from a Production database, while keeping some amount of table data intact from the prior database after the Production restore.

    Solving GraphQL’s Challenges by Robert Mosolgo

    GraphQL empowers your API clients by serving type-safe, predictable and flexible data from your application. JavaScript developers rejoice! But what about the server? Let’s explore GraphQL for Ruby servers. First, we’ll learn some GraphQL basics and see what it looks like to serve GraphQL from a Ruby app. Then, we’ll look at how we solve some web service challenges at GitHub: authentication, authorization and load management. We’ll see how these solutions compare to their REST equivalents and you’ll be ready to take GraphQL for a spin in your app!

    Robert Mosolgo, works on GraphQL at GitHub. In open-source, you’ll find him poking around with APIs, compilers, and runtimes. Besides coding, he enjoys eating, growing plants, and spending time with his family.

    SEO is Not a Four-Letter Word

    How can your startup get more users to see your app in the first pages of Google results without spending money on advertising? Together we’ll walk through a way to create your own data structures for Google to consume using JSON-LD and the data you already have–no gems or cursing necessary.

    About Katherine: I'm a history teacher turned developer currently working as a Software Engineer. I'm a proud native of Washington, DC, where I teach to learn as the Director of Education for Women Who Code DC. When I’m not bug hunting you’ll find me making awful puns, practicing the bodhran, and vociferously defending the Oxford comma.

    Type. Context. by Sam Phippen

    Every language has at least one big idea behind it. In Ruby we cherish the powers of abstraction in the language and the conventions of Rails. Experienced Ruby programmers lean on these ideas without a thought. Imagine my surprise when I changed jobs, stopped programming Ruby full time, and those ideas were nowhere around.

    This talk is the antidote to the “x language is cool talk”. It’s a talk where you’ll learn about the ideas behind a couple of current ‘hot’ languages. You’ll learn how new languages change the way you program. We’ll find some gaps in Ruby and bring some neat stuff back.

    Sam Phippen is an Engineer at DigitalOcean, RSpec core team member, and all round Ruby aficionado. You may know him for being English, but he lives in New York City now. He’s sad that he can’t hug every cat.

    Keeping Data and Integrations in Sync by Steve Hackley

    This presentation will discuss the challenges and potential solutions for refreshing multiple application
    environments (Development/Staging/UAT/etc.) with data from a Production database,
    while keeping some amount of table data intact from the prior database after the
    Production restore.
    When not white boarding out solutions with his team, Steve Hackley can be found with the hiking boots on traversing the switchbacks of the Appalachian Trail, or cooking out on the deck at home. With almost 20 years of web development and management experience in all areas including pre-sales, strategy, consulting, operations, and development, Steve has been responsible for assembling and leading several development teams implementing various technologies ( .Net Stack, BI technologies, Ruby on Rails) for clients believing in the notion 'work smarter, not harder'.

    Building the Rails ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase Framework

    At the 2014 RailsConf DHH declared system testing would be added to Rails. Three years later, Rails 5.1 makes good on that promise by introducing a new testing framework: ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase. The feature brings system testing to Rails with zero application configuration by adding Capybara integration. After a demonstration of the new framework, we'll walk through what's uniquely involved with building OSS features & how the architecture follows the Rails Doctrine. We'll take a rare look at what it takes to build a major feature for Rails, including goals, design decisions, & roadblocks.

    Eileen Uchitelle is a Senior Systems Engineer at GitHub where she works on improving the GitHub application, related systems, and the Ruby on Rails framework. Eileen is an avid contributor to open source and is a member of the Rails Core Team. She's passionate about performance, security, and getting new programmers contributing to OSS.

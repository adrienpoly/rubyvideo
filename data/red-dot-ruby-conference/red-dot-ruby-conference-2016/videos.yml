    Learning to
    write a programming language is considered a rite of passage for some programmers.
    And, it is also the most rewarding exercise as you will learn a whole lot about
    programming languages in general. Many might think it's a daunting task but I
    will show you otherwise by showing how to implement a simple language in Ruby
    and compile it to Rubinius bytecode. Be warned, only the brave and true will survive.
    Don't you worry though, no prior knowledge of parsing, lexing and programming
    language theory required. And of course, don't forget to have fun.
    Speaker's
    Bio\nJason Yeo flips bits and smashes stacks at SourceClear. Some of his interests
    include participating in pointless discussions about type systems, writing interpreters
    for languages that has no real world application, bashing languages that has real
    world applications and embedding Easter Eggs in talk descriptions.\U0001F61D

    Professional coding means writing clear, readable, maintainable code. 'Golf' in programming means implementing something with as short as possible code. Golf code is everything that a professional code shouldn't be. However, there are so many things that we can only discover by playing Ruby golf. In this talk, I will share the Ruby secrets I discovered from Ruby golf, and also the extreme ingenuity that comes into play when trying to write the shortest code to solve a problem.

    Speaker's Bio
    Joy is a cat-loving Rubyist and 'student of life' based in Manila. She is currently works as a web develop at Quipper, an EdTech company. When not into coding, she engages in other enjoyable activities where she can learn new things. Recently, she into watching anime and reading manga to improve her Japanese language skills.

    Testing Rails 5 apps has become better experience out of the box. Rails has also become smarter by introducing the test runner. Now we can't complain that about not able to run a single test or not getting coloured output. A lot of effort gone into making tests especially integration tests run faster. Come and join me as we will commence the journey to uncover the secrets of testing Rails 5 apps.

    While premature optimization might be the root of all evil, at some point, whether you want it or not, you must look at your beautiful (and of course fully tested) code, and make it a bit less pretty, but much, much faster. API performance optimization does not need to be scary, though. To start you just need some benchmarking tools and a few optimization techniques. In my talk I'm going to present example problems and solutions that will make speeding up API much easier.

    In our current market, almost of half of our employers are hiring for experienced developers. Many people move jobs every couple of years, leaving teams in an ongoing state of forming or storming, unable to find their rhythm. Company culture is a major influence on people deciding to stay in their jobs. This talk uses data gathered from over 100,000 responses to engagement and exit surveys from fast growing, successful tech companies to analyse why people leave, and how we can encourage our team members to stay (hint: it's not pay!)

    Speaker's Bio
    Jo is lead developer at Culture Amp, the world’s leading culture analytics platform. Before her current role, Jo worked at the likes of Lonely Planet, Atlasssian, ThoughtWorks and Expedia, in roles such as Product Planner, Senior Business Analyst, Development Manager and Chief Technical Officer. She was also a CTO of an Australian startup accepted into Telstra’s Muru-D program.

    When you need to contribute a new library or framework, you might try to write test and invoke the test suite with “rake test” or “rake spec”. CRuby also has a test suite like many libraries and frameworks, written in Ruby. But, It's different from typical ruby libraries. Therefore many Rubyists don't know how to run the CRuby test suite. In this talk, I explain the details of the CRuby test suite and contribution protips for CRuby's development for beginners.

    We often hear about Test Driven Development (TDD), and RSpec is a great aid in doing so. However what could be one of the biggest disadvantages of writing tests? The answer is slow tests. Yes, its true that if there were no tests then there would not be a slow test suite. But that's not the point. Tests are a developer's friend, and in this talk I will talk more about how to use FactoryGirl appropriately to speed up your RSpecs.

    Many excellent authorization system already exist as gems, however most of them left the implementation detail of storing authorization rules in database up for grabs. Storing them in database is important because it enables end user to configure it by themselves rather than depending on the developers to manage them. Learn how you can effectively store and manage authorization rules on database, effectively utilize policy-based authorization system such as Pundit for this purpose and learn about database design that can handle authorization better.

    Most Scientific Computing was restricted to languages like FORTRAN and Python, until now. The Ruby Science Foundation (SciRuby) aims to change that by creating tools for Scientific Computation in Ruby by leveraging Ruby’s elegance to reduce the inherent complexity that comes with Scientific Computing. In this talk you will be introduced to several gems developed by SciRuby for Scientific Computing. You will get a glimpse into powerful libraries like nmatrix, nyaplot and daru, that can be used for performing super fast computations and beautiful visualizations, all the while keeping code sane, simple and readable.

He is currently maintaining daru, a library for data analysis and manipulation in Ruby. He enjoys spending spare time with friends, books and his bass guitar.

After lots of back and forth, we ended up with a Sinatra application to solve salary questions. Expect to explore the topic from many different angles and levels. We'll look at decisions, realisations and implications, as well as interesting parts of the implementation.

    Rails 5 and Sprockets 3/4, have made amazing strides in terms of performance, and dev-experience. Sprockets adds various resolution fixes to speed it up by more that 12x, allows to use ES6/ES2015, adopts good approaches from npm, and adds experimental features like Subresource Integrity. On Rails too, there are many improvements for speeding up front-end resources- Custom HTTP headers for static assets, Fragment caching improvements, ETag improvements, http_cache_forever and more. In this talk, we will see how to harness many of these to speed up page loads/cache and Google Pagespeed.

His spare time is spent exploring and contributing to many Open Source ruby projects, when not dabbling with React JS.

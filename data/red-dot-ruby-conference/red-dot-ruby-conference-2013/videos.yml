    In this presentation we will look at some refactoring techniques used to transform difficult code in to something maintainable. Along the way we will learn about some internals of Rails, including design concepts and potential speed improvements. We'll learn about Rails internals and refactoring techniques, and how we can apply lessons learned to our own applications.

    JRuby is an implementation of Ruby for the JVM. It gives you unprecedented integration with the Java ecosystem while still having access to great Ruby libraries such as Rails, RSpec and many more.

    JRuby has gone from being an alternative implementation of Ruby, to a battle hardened tool that many enterprises are using in production. The update in the community means that most gems now are released with outstanding JRuby compatibility, and JRuby can still be counted as the fastest implementation of Ruby.

    In this presentation we will take a look at the reasons for using JRuby, how to get started and what things you can do with JRuby that no other platform gives you.

  description: |-
    We at the Rails world are very proud of embracing the Model-View-Controller design pattern, it is integral to the way we build web applications and there is a general consensus that all of us generally know what we are talking about in regards to it, hell , most of our code files are under a model, controller or views directories! We've got to know what we are doing, right?

    Much like Object Orientation the Model-View-Controller pattern is one of the most popular-yet-heavily-altered concepts in modern computer science, what were the original propositions of the pattern? How was it applied back in the 70's, when it was proposed as a part of Smalltalk? How much have we changed it to adapt it to the web application scene? How can we apply this to our day to day work in 2013? is altering the original pattern necessarily a bad thing?

    On this talk I present different aspects of the MVC pattern and its changes from its inception to modern day use, what to keep in mind about the pattern as opposed to a single framework's implementation of it and how knowing this should make us all around better programmers.

    Did you ever want to integrate your Ruby code in controllers and JavaScript code in the frontend? Gon is here to help with seamless serialization, DRY code and live reloading. Organize your frontend the way it deserves!

    This talk will describe several strategies of transporting data between backend and frontend with the gon gem. It covers:
    - simple variable transfer
    - complex serialization with Rabl and JBuilder templates
    - transparent synchronization of JavaScript variables with their server-side counterparts
    - easy way to set initial or global data for whole application
    - real-life examples
    - nice mood with a set of nifty pics
    - and a bit of spice: Gon internals!

  description: |-
    Rails is awesome! It makes it very easy and enjoyable to start a new project. However, as your application grows, you will eventually have to come off the Rails or your codebase will become completely unmanageable. Everyone knows that.

    You'll need presenters and a service layer, including role and use-case objects. DCI will be great too or, alternatively, you can go Hexagonal. After all, the web is just a delivery mechanism, the database is a mere persistence strategy and, of course, Rails is a detail.

    But… Wait a minute! Is that really true? Does the _Rails way_ no longer work when your application becomes large? How is it, then, that Rails claims to be “optimised for sustainable productivity”?

    In this talk, we'll revisit the patterns and conventions that Rails encourages. We'll push them to the limit and see how the maintainers of large Rails applications keep their models manageable without needing to derail. We'll also discuss the trade-offs of being on and off the Rails. And, maybe, you'll finally learn how to stop worrying and love the Rails way!

  description: |-
    Modular approach to complex RIA (rich internet applications) gives considerable advantages over the commonly used MVC: structuring code into well defined components provides for high scalability, reusability and testability of the code. Besides, with components being a Ruby class, developers have full access to such OOP techniques as inheritance and mixins.

    The Netzke open source framework takes all the hard work of enabling these techniques to create web components using Ruby for the server-side, and Sencha Ext JS for the client-side code. This talk will give you an introduction to rationale behind Netzke, as well as show you some very cool code, which will make you want to give it a try in your next project.

    We use many middlewares like memcached, redis, and some other TCP servers. When we test our app, stubbing out connections to such servers can be useful. However, we can't confirm if our code works actually fine in real situation.

    Glint is a library which allows users to fire up arbitrary TCP servers and test against those real servers without stubbing. While it's a very tiny tool, it can be used in various way combined with many servers. I'll provide a way to solve the problem described above using Glint and show you some examples how to use it.

  description: |-
    A Code Kata is a simple programming exercise, practiced repeatably by a developer. Much like a musician practices scales and finger exercises to develop his musical skills, a developer will practice code katas to develop his programming skills.

    This talk will be a live performance of a simple TDD-based code Kata, followed by an analysis of the forces and choices involved in the feedback loop between the code and the tests encountered during the kata. By examining this interaction of tests and code, we come to a better understanding of how to use tests to actively affect the direction of our design. By reflecting on the process, we understand how to pick 'what to test next'.

    This talk is targeted for developers who have started using Test Driven Design (TDD) and feel that they don't quite 'get it' yet, and are looking for guidance in the technique.

    If you were building a system that was going to be in production for 10 or 20 years, you'd be pretty serious about your development processes. As a programmer, you will likely be in production *yourself* for considerably longer than that. So how is your self-development process looking? Are you optimising yourself for current performance and long-term viability?

    In this talk we'll consider some aspects - both mental and physical - you may want to be thinking about to make sure personal and professional growth continues smoothly. And also ask if these ideas could be more prominent in how we teach and mentor other programmers.

    - Why do we need to upgrade Ruby and Rails?
    - What are the strategies available to upgrade Ruby and Rails?
    - How do we reduce technical debt?
    - How do we upgrade Rails while adding new features?
    - How do we do continuous delivery while simuluteously migrating the database?

    - The most vulnerable controller actions that hackers seek.
    - The default security mechanism of Rails for these issues and reasons why you should not bypass them.

    Snapshots are used to create a clone of your production environment where you can test all the changes before making them in production.

    Vagrant and VirtualBox are used to provide a development environment with the same OS you use in production. Chef is used to install the same packages. In fact you use the same chef recipes everywhere.

    The evolution of developer experience tooling has been a game-changer in how we build and debug web applications.

    This talk aims to showcase the path toward enriching the Ruby on Rails ecosystem with advanced DX tools, focusing on the implementation of Language Server Protocols (LSP) for Stimulus and Turbo.

    Drawing inspiration from the rapid advancements in JavaScript tooling, we explore the horizon of possibilities for Rails developers.

    The session will extend beyond LSPs, to explore the potential of browser extensions and development tools tailored specifically for Turbo, Stimulus, and Hotwire.

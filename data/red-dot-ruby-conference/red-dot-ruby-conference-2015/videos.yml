    Security Is Hard, But We Can't Go Shopping by André Arko

    Security is really important, and a lot of rubyists are unfamiliar with how it works, why it's important, how to explain it to bosses and managers, and most importantly, how to handle security vulnerabilities in code they use (or code they wrote). Let's talk about why security is important, even though Matz is nice. We'll also about what to do when vulnerabilities show up, since they always will.

    Xu\n\nWe don't see it all the time but robots that make our lives easier are already
    here with us. While they look nothing like the Transformers (cool!) or the Terminator
    (cool but scary), they affect our lives just as deeply. They assemble our cars,
    package our goods, manufacture our electronics, harvest our crops, clean our floors,
    drive our cars and even fight our wars (scary again). \n\nIn this talk, we want
    to show you how you can create and program your own autonomous robots using Ruby.
    We will show you how we built an inexpensive hexapod spider robot and how we wrote
    the software to control it, using Ruby. \n\nThis talk is inspired by Jim Weirich,
    who showed us Friendly Flying Robots with Ruby in 2013."

    web interfaces is the need of the hour. The interactions should be smooth, pages
    should load fast, changes should happen without reloading page that too as fast
    as possible. Users must feel great while using the app. But with so much complexity,
    its becoming harder and harder to keep the frontend codebase clear, predictable
    and reusable. Time to rethink! \n\nIn this talk, I will first give an overview
    of React.js, a JavaScript library from Facebook for building user interfaces,
    covering core concepts such as building and composing components, virtual DOM,
    immutable data structures, one way data flow - which makes React really shine.
    \n\nAfter that, we will dive straight into an example where I will show how Rails
    can leverage power of React. Most importantly, audience will understand power
    of rethinking existing best practices. \n\nLets start (re)thinking!"

    it much harder for a junior? Will I be able to learn from my co-workers when I’m
    remote? How the heck do I get my company to agree to this? And even if they agree,
    how do I make it work? \n\nI’m going to share from personal experience how, yes,
    it is harder for a junior, but it’s definitely possible and can even be a great
    personal and professional experience. Starting out with how to negotiate a remote
    work agreement with your company in the first place, this talk will then continue

    decentralized distributed system that consists of multiple processes, called nodes,

    as an OSS product written in Ruby from 2007. \n\nI will also share a GUI management

    we don't always write beautiful code. In fact, most of our early code is quite
    bad. So we try to refactor it. \n\nBut refactoring also plays a significant role
    in our personal lives. As programmers, we 'refactor' ourselves on a daily basis.
    We implement different technologies, learn new skills, and confront our own mistakes
    every day -- all in an effort to become better at what we do. And in the process,
    we become better iterations of ourselves. \n\nThis talk will explore how programming
    challenges us to not only refactor our own code, but also our very own sense of
    self."

    \n\nOh, and some people really hate them. \n\nWe're talking important people here.
    A few prominent community members tried to convince Matz to remove Refinements
    from Ruby. The latest JRuby is compatible with Matz's Ruby 2... except that it
    lacks Refinements. This innocent feature might end up splitting the Ruby ecosystem.
    \n\nAre Refinements the best idea since blocks and modules, or a terrible mistake?
    Decide for yourself. In twenty minutes, I'll tell you the good, the bad and the
    ugly about refinements. At the end of this speech, you'll understand the trade-offs

    issue or apply a \"lousy\" patch. \n\nHaving gone through the process, I hope
    to help answer those questions and give confidence to new developers that have
    yet to contribute to open source projects because of such fears. There are tools
    and techniques which I have learnt and picked up that can help new developers
    understand a foreign code base better which I would like to demonstrate as well.

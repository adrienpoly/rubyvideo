  title: EMEA on Rails 2021
  location: Earth
  description: 'The conference experience, minus the jetlag! There are so many Rubyists in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, but we haven"t managed to gather much in the past year, and we could definitely learn a lot from each other. Let"s get together (virtually for now) and experience some of the excitement of an international conference (remember those?), without jetlag or timezone challenges! Our first event will be a meetup-of-meetups featuring EMEA speakers from this past RailsConf and recent EMEA conferences.'

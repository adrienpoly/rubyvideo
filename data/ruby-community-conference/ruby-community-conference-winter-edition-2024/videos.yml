    Renaissance of Ruby on Rails - Ruby on Rails blazed trails in popular web application development with Convention Over Configuration, brought a version of MVC to the masses. All of this in the beautiful, expressive, and enjoyable Ruby programming language.

    But web development moved away. Organisations wanted to split their development teams, and add complexity to the process using micro-services, bifurcating development teams, and complicating deployments with containerisation. Ruby on Rails fell behind the popular curve, and Ruby on Rails entered the Dark Ages.

    In this talk, Steven will explore how the latest release of Ruby on Rails delivers us out of the Dark Ages, and back into the freedom offered by Full-Stack. You will see how, using just what’s built in to Rails, you can deliver highly interactive applications, and take advantage of the benefits of containerised deployments, without complicating your development and deployment workflows.

    Let’s celebrate the Renaissance of Ruby on Rails together!

    Future- Proofing Ruby Gems: Strategies For Long-Term Maintenance

    Embark on an advanced journey with Maciej, where he offers a deep dive into the planning and foresight required when building Ruby OSS gems. This session transcends typical development discussions, focusing on the unique considerations necessary for creating open-source software that stands the test of time. Maciej will share insights from his experience, highlighting the importance of thoughtful decision-making in an environment where a simple fix is not always an option.

    Attendees will learn how to avoid common pitfalls that lead to long-term issues, understand the nuances of building non-standard applications, and gain a new perspective on the delicate balance required to create robust, future-proof open-source software. This talk is an invitation to think differently about software development, encouraging a deep commitment to quality and sustainability in the OSS community.

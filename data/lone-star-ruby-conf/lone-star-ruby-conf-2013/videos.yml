    This talk explores how the widespread proliferation of cheap sensors of all kinds will create a vast collective memory for the planet which will serve as a record of every cause and effect. This data will be scoured for associations that will be turned into algorithms which optimize every decision we have to make in life. And while we may not always choose to do those things, it will effectively make every person on the planet vastly wiser than the wisest person who has ever lived. In the future, no one will ever need to make a mistake again.

    Elixir: Power of Erlang, Joy of Ruby

    I'm a language nut. I love trying them out, and I love thinking about their design and implementation. (I know, it's sad.)

    I came across Ruby in 1998 because I was an avid reader of comp.lang.misc (ask your parents). I downloaded it, compiled it, and fell in love. As with any time you fall in love, it's difficult to explain why. It just worked the way I work, and it had enough depth to keep me interested.

    Fast forward 15 years. All that time I'd been looking for something new that gave me the same feeling.

    Then I came across Elixir, a language by José Valim, that puts a humane, Ruby-like syntax on the Erlang VM.

    Now I'm dangerous. I want other people to see just how great this is. I want to evangelize. I won't try to convert you away from Ruby. But I might just persuade you to add Elixir to your toolset.

    So come along and let me show you the things that I think make Elixir a serious alternative for writing highly reliable, scalable, and performant server code.

    And, more important, let me show you some fun stuff.

    Ruby is a delightful language to work with. And yet, for years, we've been hearing about how MRI is too slow and inefficient for "serious" use. What does that mean? What would a "serious" Ruby runtime look like?

    To understand these questions, we need to dig into the design of MRI. How does it work, and what are the underlying principles? What does common Ruby code look like as its executed by MRI? Once we've discovered what makes MRI tick, we can compare it to modern runtimes like Hotspot and V8 to understand why MRI is slower. From there we can take a look at JRuby and Rubinius and see how they seek to close the gap between Ruby runtimes and the competition.

    In this talk, we'll dive into the internals of MRI, seeking to understand how it executes Ruby code. We'll look at ways to make our code faster, reduce garbage collection overhead, and find more concurrency in our programs. At the end, you will have a better understanding of how MRI works and how to write better code for it.

    Rails as a framework is famous for getting an application up and running quickly, but the very paradigms that make it so easy at the start can lead to maintenance nightmares down the road. Successful applications grow rapidly larger, more complex, and harder to extend and maintain. One way to approach refactoring a monolithic application is dividing it up into a series of smaller applications that organize the work of the system through internal APIs and message queues. In this presentation you will be introduced to tools to enable this architecture, gain insight on how best to use them, and explore the guiding principles behind the SOA approach to refactoring.

    Time and time again, skilled developers with good intentions set out into the green field of their new Rails app. Alas, as days turn to weeks, weeks to months and months to years, they find themselves with an ever increasing maintenance burden. Adding new features in a well-designed way starts to feel like an exercise in futility, so they resort to liberal use of conditionals to avoid breaking existing code.

    This leads to more complexity, and on the cycle goes.

    It doesn't need to be like this. There's no silver bullet that will save your project from this fate, but by practicing a holistic approach to code quality you can stave off the maintenance monsters and keep your app's code feeling fresh and clean. This talk will look at low ceremony, common sense approaches to taking control of the quality of your codebase. You'll leave with an expanded toolbox of techniques to build a culture of quality within your organization.

    Shifting from an amateur web developer hacking away at my own projects in my living room to a professional Software Engineer at a startup in San Francisco was a huge change in the way I developed. After joining Mavenlink a year ago I went from tiny apps that were 100% my code, with fast test suites, hosted on Heroku to a giant Rails app with a complicated data model, a CI test suite that took an hour, and a legacy codebase touched by 30+ people. I've worked hard the last year to step up to the challenge and I've learned so much in the process. As the developer pool gets more and more junior there will be more people making the same journey as I did.

    In this talk I will cover:

    skills that are important (some I had, others I had to develop)
    iteration planning
    testing
    debugging/support
    polyglot skills
    contributing to a team much more skilled than you
    pair-programming with someone much more senior or junior than you
    how culture at Mavenlink has helped me succeed
    what you can do to help onboard and train up your Junior Developers
    things you should look for in a Junior Developer candidate

    Rails Engines are useful. We can make our code well structured and reusable using Engines.

    Rails Engines are fun. You can publish your Engine repo to the world, then make yourself and the world better and happier.

    Rails Engine is a sophisticated system. Even though 猿人 (en-jin) in Japanese means "ape-man".

    Rails Engine is zen. Everything in our Rails app is an Engine, and Engine is everything. Even the Rails app itself should also be an Engine.

    During my talk, you will get to know what exactly Rails::Engine is, and you will see some of my crazy Engine tips, ideas, and implementations around Rails::Engine.

    TDD has been tattered, torn, twisted, stood on its head, and pounded into an pulp of techno-fetishism. TDD was a game-changer, but the focus in the interceding years has shifted from technique to tools, and TDD has been devolving into a lost art. By tearing TDD down to its bones, this presentation presents TDD in its essence, free of tools, and reinforcing the primary focus on design principles. It attempts to convince you to return to a simpler time when TDD was still about design, and software developers were dutifully steeped in the critical importance of design principles. To avoid being held to any particularly offensive positions, this talk liberally attacking the status quo of testing and contemporary tool-focused TDD in Ruby, while introducing yet-another testing library in Ruby. :)

    I hate to break it to you, guys, but Ruby is old enough to drink. What started out as a small community full of fun, silliness, and connection has been growing. Our small codebases are now large. Our small companies are now large. And the large companies have finally figured out that they want in, too.

    So maybe it's time to start tackling Real Problems and Real Solutions in the world of Real Innovation. Maybe it's time for the community to grow up, stop playing around, and get Serious™.

    But...that's not who we are. Our community thrives on creativity, play, and luck. And those things aren't just a weird perk like not having to wear shoes in the office -- creativity, play, and luck, when present, actually produce better software. As we grow our projects and our teams and invade the corporate cube farm, there are some things we can lay aside, and there are others we must hold on to as if our very identity depended on them.

    Because it does.

    Many of us came to Ruby by way of Rails (including yours truly about six years ago). We came because our current solutions were clumsy and inconvenient. We came because we appreciated the relative simplicity that Rails offered. And we came because we believe that change is often a good thing.

    But not all changes are beneficial.

    Over several blog posts, books, and a couple of years, the Rails community has begun to choose complexity over simplicity. Let's talk about why. And let's talk about how we can try to recapture that simplicity that we so once adored.

    By Alan Skorkin - Why You Should Love The Command-Line And Get Rid of Your Rake Tasks Once and For All

    Rake is ubiquitous in our community, it's in just about every project. But why is this so, it is awkward and inflexible (try passing some arguments to rake tasks), and the way we've come to use it almost encourages bad design. Interestingly we've had a better way, to handle the things that we use Rake for, since before Rake even existed - command-line apps. Apps that do one task and do it well, it's the unix philosophy.

    The problem is that as far as most of us know, writing a good command-line app in Ruby is not easy. Fiddling with OptionParser to produce a hacky script is no better than Rake, if anything it is worse. But what if we had the technology to build excellent command-line apps simply and easily? Well, to some extent we already do, but most of the tools available don't go far enough and so never become a viable Rake alternative.

    In this talk we'll try to figure out what features a command-line framework needs to become your go-to tool instead of Rake (and how close existing tools are to this ideal). We'll cover things like:

    What exactly is so bad about Rake
    What makes a good command-line interface
    Configuring your command-line apps
    What are your options for parsing options
    Can a command-line framework encourage good code design?
    Writing highly testable CLI apps
    Etc.
    And as an added bonus, while we talk about all this, we'll touch on good and bad code design as well as look at some of the unexpected corners of your app where 'bad' code is hiding.

    Neural networks (NNs) not only sound really cool, but they can also solve some pretty interesting problems ranging from driving cars to spam detection to facial recognition.

    Solving problems with NNs is challenging, because actually implementing a NN from scratch is difficult, and knowing how to apply it is more difficult. Fortunately, libraries, such as RubyFANN, exist to handle the first problem. Solving the second problem comes from experience.

    This talk will show a few different approaches to applying NNs to such problems as spam detection and games, as well as discussing other areas where NNs might be a useful solution.

    The talk is a narrative retelling of how I took an application that needed to communicate with a slow external API and improved the user's experience in terms of speed. I'll talk about the situation that we started with, and then retell the story of measurement, and improvement and measurement and improvement.

    I'll talk about perftools.rb, improving the perception of speed without having to actually make your code faster, MRI's Threads (when they're a good fit, and how and why we used them), a few strategies for managing threads, and a few other related topics. None of these topics will be discussed in great depth; the format is intended to be a retelling of the project, so I'll limit my discussion to the scope of how it applied to this specific project.

    The talk will probably be of most interest to people who have little real-world experience with MRI's Threads and/or making users feel like an application is responding quickly. My hope is that showing these things in the context of a real project can help solidify understanding of topics that are often covered in contrived or theoretical examples (I know it did for me: I was totally new to a lot of this stuff when I started the project).

    While Ruby is a terrific language, it doesn't offer a lot of ways to deal with
    asynchronous tasks using the default libraries. Thankfully, the community has
    come up with several great options for bringing asynchronicity to your applications.
    Resque is one of the forerunners of this, and it offers a lot of functionality and
    flexibility with an easily approachable API. Here, we'll go over several techniques
    for utilizing asynchronous workers to benefit your projects.

    We'll start off with a review of how asynchronous processing works, and then we'll
    delve into three different things you can use Resque for:
    speeding up your applications by processing slow operations on the side, performing
    sequential updates with pipelining, and performing periodic maintenance tasks.
    We'll go over example code for how to handle these different situations and ideas
    for how to integrate them with existing applications.

    While the examples will be given using Resque, the ideas and patterns discussed will
    be applicable to other worker queues, such as delayed_job and Sidekiq.

    It's been scientifically proven that more diverse communities and workplaces create better products and the solutions to difficult problems are more complete and diverse themselves. Companies are struggling to find adequate talent. So why do we see so few women, people of color, and LGBTQ people at our events and on the about pages of our websites? Even more curiously, why do 60% of women leave the tech industry within 10 years? Why are fewer women choosing to pursue computer science and related degrees than ever before? Why have stories of active discouragement, dismissal, harassment, or worse become regular news?

    In this talk we'll examine the causes behind the lack of diversity in our communities, events, and workplaces. We'll discuss what we can do as community members, event organizers, and co-workers to not only combat this problem, but to encourage positive change by contributing to an atmosphere of inclusivity.

    Objectives:

    Educate about the lack of diversity and why it is a problem
    Examine what is contributing to both the pipeline issue as well as attrition
    Isolate what is and isn't working
    Inspire direct action by examining our own behavior and learning more about the people around us so we can empathize better

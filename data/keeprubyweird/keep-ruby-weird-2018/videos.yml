    Keep Ruby Weird 2018 - Distributed Fizz Buzz: Passing the Microservices Interview by Nathan Ladd & Scott Bellware

    Scott Bellware is a short, bald man with 25 years of experience who works with development teams who have completely screwed themselves into an intractable mess of tightly-coupled monolithic madness by paying attention to cute people rather than smart people. Scott is a contributor to the Eventide toolkit for event-sourced, autonomous services in Ruby, but Scott does it better than Nathan, and he’s totally not bitter.
